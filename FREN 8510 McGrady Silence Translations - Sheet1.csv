2439,When the child had learned enough,Quant l’enfes est de tel doctrine,When the child was old enough,When the child had such learning,"Keeping ""learning"" here rather than emphasizing age is important because just before this passage Heldris describes the way the nurse and the seneschal educate Silence, and he repeats the word ""doctrine"" throughout that sequence."
2440,"to understand that he was a girl,","Qu’il entent bien qu’il est mescine,",to understand he was a girl,that he well understood that he was a girl,
2441,"his father had a talk with him,","Ses pere l’a mis a raison,",his father sat down to reason with him,"his father reasoned with him,","""metre a raison"" is to have a talk with someone or to address someone, but I think it is important to emphasize the word ""reason"" here since the allegorical figure ""Reason"" will soon arrive to talk to Silence"
2442,and told him the reason,Se li demostre l’oquoison,and explain the circumstances,and showed him the cause,
2443,they concealed and hid him.,Por que on le coile si et cuevre.,which had led them to conceal his identity this way.,for which they cultivated and covered him so.,"There is an apparent play on words here between the noun ""coil"" meaning ""testicule"" and the verb ""coillier"" meaning ""to collect/to harvest/to gather"". Here we see a connection between raising Silence as a boy and his family's ability to protect the inheritance of their lands. There is another apparent play on words between ""cuevre"" meaning ""a quiver"" and ""cuivriier"" (to torment), ""covrir"" (to cover)."
2444,“If King Ebain knew what,“Se li rois Ebayns seüst l’uevre,"“If, dear son, King Evan knew",“If the king Ebain knew the creation,
2445,"we have done with you, dear son,","Que nos de vos, bials fils, menons,","what we are doing with you,","that we are making of you, fair son,",
2446,your portion of what we have on earth,De quanque nos sos ciel avons,your share of our earthly possessions,of all that we have under heaven,
2447,would be very small indeed;,Estroit li vostre pars petite;,would be very small indeed.,your portion would be small;,"""Portion"" feels like the best word choice to me here because it recalls the Biblical theme of one's ""portion"" granted by God"
2448,"for the king, fair son, has disinherited","Car li rois, bials fils, desirite","For the king, dear son, disinherited","for the king, fair son, disinherited",
2449,"all the women in England,","Toltes les femes d’Engletiere,",all the women of England,"all the women of England,",
2450,all because of a war,Tolt par l’oquoison d’une guerre,on account of the death of two counts,all because of a war,
2451,between two counts who died,De .ii. contes ki en moururent,in battle they fought,between two counts who died in it,
2452,Because of two twins who lived then.,Par .ii. jumieles ki dunt furent.,over twin heiresses they had married.,for two twins with whom they were bound.,
2453,"Fair dear son, it is not for ourselves","Bials dols ciers fils, n’est pas por nos","Dear sweet precious son, we are not doing this","Fair sweet dear son, it is not for us",
2454,that we do this; it is for you.,"Cho que faisons, ainz est por vos.","for ourselves, but for you.","that we do so, rather it is for you.",
2455,"You now know the entire reason, son.","Tolte l’oquoison, fils savés.","Now, son, you know the whole situation.","The whole cause, son, you know.",
2456,"As you hold our honor dear,","Si chier come l’onor avés,","As you cherish honor,","As dearly as you hold honor,",
2457,conceal yourself from everyone.”,Si vos covrés viers tolte gent.”,you will continue to conceal yourself from everyone.”,so will you cover yourself from everyone.”,"I know this is a bit awkward here, but I like how ""cover"" also has the message of shielding oneself from harm. Plus, the motif of cover/discover will be important later."
2458,And the child answered sweetly,"Et cil respont moult dolcement,","And he replied very sweetly,","And this [child] responded so sweetly,",
2459,"and quickly, like a good child:","Briément, al fuer de sage enfant:","briefly, as befits a well-bred child,","briefly, with the disposition of a refined child:","""Fuer"" having the dual meaning of ""price""/""rate"" or ""manner""/fashion"" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. ""Disposition"" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like ""refined"" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is ""refined"" as in ""educated"" and ""refined"" as in ""processed"""
2460,"“Do not fear anything at all,","“Ne vos cremés, ne tant ne quant,",“Don’t worry the least little bit.,"“Don’t sweat it one bit,","""Cremer"" can mean ""bruler, embraser"" or ""craindre"" -> So I've gone a bit informal here with ""sweat it"" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly ""sweat"" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text."
2461,for if it please God I will indeed,"Car, se Deu plaist, bien le ferai,","So help me God, I will do it.","For, so help me God, I’ll do it.","This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in ""chastise""/""chasten"" --> ""to make pure, chaste"". Silence will be able to live as a ""man"" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb ""castier"" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb ""chastrer"" --> ""to castrate."""
2462,conceal myself from everyone.”,Viers tolte gent me coverrai.”,I will conceal myself from everyone.”,I will cover myself from everyone.”,
2463,"His father admonished him often,",Moult le castie biel li pere,"The father gave him much good advice,",The father often chastised him,
2464,"and so did his mother,","Et alsi fait sovent la mere,","as did the mother often,","And often so did the mother,",
2465,"the seneschal, and the nurse.",Li senescals et la norice.,and the seneschal and the nurse;,"the seneschal, and the nurse.",
2466,Everyone urged him to do right.,De faire bien cascun l’entice.,they all urged him to be good.,Each incited him to do well.,"The etymology of this word includes a connotation of flames from the Latin ""titio"" for ""firebrand"" --> ""set on fire"" --> ""to fan the flames of"" --> ""to encourage."" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat, but I've gone with ""incite"" because of its negative connotations. I see some humor in this line as they are perhaps encouraging Silence to do the wrong thing well."
2467,He possessed such understanding,Il est de tel entendement,He was receptive to their teaching,He had such an intention,"I feel like Silence's choice in all of this has been somewhat downplayed. Silence proves him/herself capable of making choices, and clearly so many people would not be trying to reason with him/her if it weren't for the fear that (s)he would disobey their wishes."
2468,that he believed their instruction fully.,Qu’il croit bien lor castiement.,and heeded their admonitions well.,To have faith in their chastisement.,My religious turn of phrase here is intentional.
2469,"The seneschal, to improve the child",Li senescals por essaucier,In order to build up his endurance,"The seneschal, to raise [him] in honor",
2470,"and to teach him to ride,",Et por apprendre a chevalcier,"and teach him to ride, the seneschal",And to teach [him] to ride,
2471,"took him to the woods and streams,",Le maine en bos et en rivieres,"took him through woods and streams,",maneuvered him through woods and streams,"I chose this verb to reflect how the OF ""maine"" has the word ""main"" (""hand"") in it and to reflect how the seneschal is physically shaping Silence. Plus, the word ""maneuver"" has the connotation of a military exercise, which is kind of what Silence is being trained for as (s)he gains knightly skills."
2472,of which there were many in that country.,Ki sunt el païs bien plenieres.,which were plentiful in the countryside.,which were rather plentiful in the land.,
2473,"He took him most often out in the sun,",Sel mainne plus sovent el halle,"He took him out often in the scorching heat,",He maneuvered him so very often in the broiling sun,
2474,to make him look more like a boy.,Par cho quel violt faire plus malle. /,in order to make a man of him.,So that such a (bridle path / beaten path) might make [him] more male.,"One could simply interpret this word ""violt"" as ""voloir"", but other obliquely related words come to mind as well. From ""voielete"" as in ""sentier"" (""path""), and the word also brings to mind the verb ""vïoler"" meaning either ""to play the viol"" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or ""to dishonor""/""to take by force""/""to violate"". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated."
2475,"The child was so used to masculine ways,",Il a us d’ome tant usé,He was so used to men’s usage,He was so used to men’s customs,
2476,"and had so refused the feminine,",Et cel de feme refusé,and had so rejected women’s ways,and had refused those of women,
2477,that he very nearly was a boy;,Que poi en falt que il n’est malles:,that little was lacking for him to be a man.,that little was lacking for him to be male:,
2478,what could be seen of him was entirely male.,Quanque on en voit est trestolt malles.,Whatever one could see was certainly male!,All that one saw of him was quite male.,"I like ""quite"" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of ""quite"" differently as meaning either ""very much"" or ""somewhat"""
2479,"But he had other than masculine qualities in his makeup,",El a en tine que ferine:,But there’s more to this than meets the eye —,But one cannot judge a book by its cover:,"I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the book cover idiom conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing."
2480,"for he was, beneath his clothes, a girl.",Il est desos les dras mescine.,the he’s a she beneath the clothes.,"Under the covers, he was a girl.",
2481,In the early years the seneschal,Li senescals sor tolte rien,The seneschal watched the child closely,"The seneschal, against all else",
2482,"guarded him well, above all things.",Es premiers an le garda bien.,"during his early years,","in the early years, kept watch over him.",
2483,"The more the child grew in size,","Com plus croist l’enfes en grandece,","but the older he grew,","As the child grew in stature,",My translation emphasizes Silence's growth in size as well as status.
2484,the more his abilities improved.,Tant amenrist plus sa destrece.,the easier that seneschal’s task became.,So the more diminished his distress.,"""Destrece"" (and its English equivalent ""distress"") carries the connotations of both physical and financial hardship. As a legal term ""distress"" specifically refers to the seizure of property, which is the threat looming over Silence."
2485,"When one cannot commit folly,",Quant on n’i puet folie ataindre,"When one could find no folly in him,",Since he couldn’t give rise to trouble there,"""Ataindre"" can have the connotation of parentage, so I almost translated it to ""engender"", but that felt a bit too on the nose."
2486,why should anyone restrain him?,Por quoi le devroit on destraindre?,what was the use of restraining him?,why should anyone hold him back?,
2487,The fact that he feared to lose his birthright,Cho qu’il crient sa droiture perdre,What they thought would cause him to be unsteady,Since they feared the loss of his rights,
2488,made him stick even closer to wisdom.,Le fait plus a savoir aherdre.,only caused him to adhere more closely to discretion.,that fact taught him to adhere even more.,"I see some irony in this line as Silence's family is securing his ""rights"" while restricting his movements."
2489,His own heart taught him,Ses cuers meïsmes bien l’escole,His heart itself schooled him,His own heart schooled him,
2490,to avoid foolish behavior.,Al deguerpir maniere fole.,to eschew foolish behavior.,to renounce foolish manners.,"I chose the verb ""renounce"" because of how it can be used to decline a role or position. Silence is forced to adopt one role while turning down another."
2491,"Thus he had sufficient inclination,",Por cho a il lassor assés,"Because of this, he was given a good deal of freedom.",Because of this he had free rein,"I'm playing here with the earlier references to horseback riding. Silence may have a long leash, but (s)he is still bridled. I also like the pun of ""rein"" and ""reign"" that ties in the issue of social class and inheritance."
2492,"and by the time he was eleven,",Et quant il ot .xi. ans passés,"And by the time was in his twelfth year,",And when after he had passed eleven,
2493,there was no one more adept than he:,N’i a un seul de lui plus maistre.,none was his master any more.,there was not a one more masterly than he,"I think it's important to keep the word ""master"" here as Silence is being raised to be a young noble boy, aka a ""master"""
2494,"when they played at jousting,","Quant il joent a le palaistre,","When they practiced wrestling,","when they played at wrestling,",
2495,"at tilting, or at swords,","A bohorder, n’a l’escremir,","jousting or skirmishing,","at jousting, or at fencing,",
2496,he alone made all his peers tremble.,Il seus fait tols ses pers fremir.,he alone made all his peers tremble.,he alone made all of his peers quiver.,"""Quiver"" as in the noun appears several times in this narrative, and one might ""quiver"" with fear, pleasure, and anticipation. All of this physical contact with the other boys might have provoked the same effect Silence will later have on the King of France."
2497,"Silence improved at these immensely,","[S]ilences forment s’enasprist,","Silence was deeply disturbed about this,",They made Silence exasperated with himself,
2498,for his heart taught him,Car ses corages li aprist,for her conscience told her,for his heart told him,
2499,to do so for concealment’s sake.,Ke si fesist par couverture.,that she was practicing deception by doing this.,that what he was doing was a sham.,"I like ""sham"" here because it conveys both a deception and a covering as in a pillow sham."
2500,"After twelve years, Nature came to him,",Apriés .xii. ans si vint Nature,"In her twelfth year, Nature appeared,",After twelve years then came Nature,
2501,talking with him and reproaching him sternly.,Ki le blasme forment et coze.,grumbling and complaining and blaming her.,who condemned and complained about their making of her,
2502,"She told him, “Here is a strange thing,","Dist li: “Chi a estrange coze,","She said to her, “This is a fine state of affairs,","She said to him: “What a strange case,",
2503,"that you behave like a boy,","Ki te deduis al fuer de malle,","you conducting yourself like a man,","that you play at being a male,",
2504,"going out in the wind and the sun,","Et vas si al vent et al halle,",running about in the wind and scorching sun,"and go out in the wind and the broiling sun,",
2505,when I had a special mold from which,Car une speciäl forme ai,"when I used a special mold for you,",when I had a special frame,
2506,I formed you with my own two hands.,Dont a mes .ii. mains te formai.,"when I created you with my own hands,",with which I formed you with my own two hands.,
2507,And the beauty I saved up for so long,Et la bialtet qu’ai tant celé[e],when I heaped all the beauty I had stored up,And the beauty that I had so sealed away,"I am using ""seal"" in Nature's speech because it combines the action of storing/concealing (as in in a cellar) with the sealing of a legal agreement. Maintaining Silence's body as male is what seals the deal of her inheritance. This also supports Nature's use of the word ""scel"" in verse 2516."
2508,I concentrated all in you.,Ai tolte en toi amoncelee.,upon you alone!,all of it I had accumulated for you.,
2509,A thousand people consider me stingy,.m. gens me tienent por escarse,There are a thousand people who think I’m stingy,A thousand people take me for a miser,
2510,"in beauty, of which you are full;","Por la bialté, dont tu iés farse;","because of the beauty I stuffed you with,","for the beauty I stuffed you with,","""Farse"" (or ""farce"") can refer to an absurdity, or in a culinary sense, it can also refer to stuffing. Here we can see a double meaning as Nature sees Silence making a mockery of her own substance so carefully prepared by Nature."
2511,"for I withheld beauty from a thousand others,",Car jo ai de .m. gens retraite,for I extracted the beauty of a thousand,for I retained from a thousand people,
2512,which I used to make you.,"La bialté, dont tu iés refaite.",to create your lovely appearance!,the beauty with which you remain.,
2513,There are a thousand women in this life,.m. femes a en ceste vie,And there are a thousand women in this world,There are a thousand women in this life,
2514,who will greatly desire you,Ki de toi ont moult grant envie,who are madly in love with you,who covet you so greatly,
2515,"for the beauty they will see in you,","Por le bialté qu’eles i voient,",because of the beauty they see in you —,"for the beauty that they see in you,",
2516,and because they will think to find in you,Car puet scel estre eles i croient,you don’t suppose they think something’s there,for they believe there may be sealed there,
2517,something that is not there at all.,Tel cose qu’en toi nen a mie.,that was never part of your equipment at all?,a certain something that you don’t have at all.,
2518,"And one woman may be your good friend now,",Et tels est ore moult t’amie /,There are those who love you now,And some woman who might love you so much now,
2519,who would hate you with all her heart,"Qui te haroit de tolt le cuer,",who would hate you with all their hearts,"who would harass you with all her heart,",
2520,if she knew your real nature;,"Se il de toi savoit le fuer,",if they knew what you really are!,if she knew about your lot,"My use of ""lot"" here is meant to convey the multiple meanings of ""fuer"", which can refer to the price or amount of something as well as to a person's disposition (in this passage alone see also verses 2459, 2503, 2561). ""Lot"" also conveys how Silence's identity as a man is meant to secure a plot of land."
2521,for she would consider herself deceived,Qu’el s’en tenroit a malballie,"They would consider themselves misused,","for in this she would count herself maltreated for it,","Reading around this word ""malballie"" lends itself to some possibilities for sexual innuendo. For example in ""malbaillir"", we have the verb ""baillier"" meaning ""céder la jouissance ou l'exploitation d'un bien pour un prix et une durée fixés par contrat"", and from there we can see ""bailliee"" which refers to ""permission de prendre du bois""."
2522,because her hope failed.,Que s’esperance estroit fallie.,Having their hopes so cruelly dashed.,she and her aspirations would be crestfallen.,This hypothetical scenario set forward by Nature is almost certainly foreshadowing Eufeme's later attempts on Silence who will herself describe their encounter in economic terms (see verses 3884-8).
2523,Certainly you do me great wrong,"Tu me fais, certes, grant laidure","It’s a very nasty thing you’re doing to me,","You do me, to be sure, an ugly thing","The Matsumura dictionary also offers ""parties génitales"" as a possible use for the word ""laidure."" It may be that Nature is specifically referring to the misuse of her handiwork in that department."
2524,when you follow such an upbringing.,Quant tu maintiens tel noreture.,leading this sort of life.,when you maintain such nurturing.,
2525,"You must not travel the woods,","Ne dois pas en bos converser,","You have no business going off into the forest,","You should not be out cavorting in the woods,","""Converser"" can mean ""demeurer,"" ""fréquenter,"" ""avoir des rapports,"" or ""avoir des relations charnelles"""
2526,"throw, or shoot, or hunt.","Lancier, ne traire, ne berser.","jousting, hunting, shooting off arrows.","lancing, nor traipsing, nor shooting.",
2527,Get away from here!” said Nature.,Tol toi de chi!” cho dist Nature.,Desist from all of this!” said Nature.,Get yourself out of here!” so said Nature.,
2528,"“Stay in the side-chambers,","“Va en la cambre a la costure,",“Go to a chamber and learn to sew!,"“Go sew in your chamber,”","We have again a possible double entendre as ""costure"" can refer to sewing or the cultivation of land (a common metaphor for reproduction). I invite the English reader to hear sew/sow in this line."
2529,for nature demands this!,Cho violt de nature li us.,That’s what Nature’s usage wants of you!,"This is Nature’s path, custom for him.","Here again we can see desired paths for Silence (see also verses 2474, 2543, and 2614 in this passage). I have pulled this line out of Nature's speech because it feels more natural as an interjection from the narrator."
2530,You are not Silentius!”,Tu nen es pas Scilentius!”,You are not Silentius!”,“You are not Silentius!”,
2531,"He answered, “I never heard such a thing!",Et cil respont: “Tel n’oï onques!,"and he replied, “I never hear that before!",And this [child] responded: “I never heard such a thing!,
2532,Silentius! Who am I then?,Silencius! qui sui jo donques?,Not Silentius? Who am I then?,Silentius! Who am I then?,
2533,"My name is Silentius, I think,","Silencius ai non, jo cui,","Silentius is my name, I think,","I have the name Silentius, I thought,",
2534,or I am someone else than I was.,U jo sui altres que ne fui.,or I am other than who I was.,or I am somebody I wasn’t.,
2535,"But this I know well, by my right hand,","Mais cho sai jo bien, par ma destre,","But this I know well, upon my oath,","But well I know, by my right,",
2536,that I cannot be any other!,Que jo ne puis pas altres estre!,that I cannot be anybody else!,that I can’t be anybody else!,
2537,"So I am Silentius,","Donques sui jo Scilentius,","Therefore, I am Silentius,","So I am Silentius,",
2538,"it seems to me, or I am no one.”","Cho m’est avis, u jo sui nus.”","As I see it, or I am no one.”","it seems to me, or I am nobody,”","Many have called attention to this word ""nus"" as implying nudity as well as negation. I have rendered it as ""nobody"" to call attention to Silence's body, which will be made nude at the end of the narrative."
2539,He thought to himself,Dont se porpense en lui meïsme,But then she convinced herself,Then he reflected on it himself,
2540,that Nature was speaking in sophistries;,Que Nature li fait sofime:,that Nature’s spurious argument was plausible:,on the sophistry Nature made him:,
2541,"because the -us was against natural law,",Por cho que l’-us est encontre us,"That because the -us was contrary to usage,","That this -us was contrary to custom,",
2542,his name was not Silentius.,N’a pas a non Scilentius.,her name was not Silentius.,"that his name was not Silentius,",
2543,He wanted to stay in the chamber,Aler en violt a la costure,"She wanted to go and learn to sew,",wanting him to go sew,
2544,"as Nature had entreated him to,","Si com li a rové Nature,",just as Nature demanded of her;,"just as Nature had raved at him,",
2545,because neither for a fief nor an inheritance,"Car por fief, ne por iretage,",she should not cultivate such savage ways,"that for neither fief nor heritage,",
2546,should he keep up such a barbarous usage.,Ne doit mener us si salvage.,for fief or inheritance.,he must not manifest so savage a custom.,"Pushing against both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi, I do not think Silence has been convinced by Nature so quickly. In this section, I see Silence mulling over Nature's suggestions without fully accepting them, especially since Nature's discourse is referred to as ""sofime."""
2547,"At this point Nurture arrived,",Atant i sorvint Noreture,But then Nurture arrived on the scene,Suddenly there came Nurture,
2548,and saw Silence speaking to Nature.,Et voit que parole a Nature.,and saw that he was talking to Nature,who saw that he was talking to Nature.,
2549,"She asked him, “Whatever are you doing here?”","Di li: “Que fais tu, diva, chi?”","and said to him, “Hey! What are you doing here?”","She said to him: “Say, what are you doing here?”",
2550,"He answered, “Nature is quarreling with me.",Cil dist: “Nature tence a mi.,"He said, “Nature is scolding me,","This [child] said, “Nature is contending with me.",
2551,"And in faith, it is not wrong","Et si n’est pas, par foi, a tort","and she’s right, in fact,","And so it isn’t, by faith, wrong",
2552,for her to show me and acquaint me with,Qu’ele m’acostume et amort,to get me accustomed,that she accustom and mortify me,
2553,"the usage that is lawful,","A tel us ki est droitureus,","to appropriate habits,","to such customs that are righteous,",
2554,for this one is not natural.,Car cis us n’es pas natureus.,for this behavior is unnatural.,for this custom is not natural.,
2555,"Truly, no woman of my lineage","Ainc feme, voir, de mon parage,","Truly, no woman of my lineage","See here, never did a woman of my parentage",
2556,"ever led such a life as this,","Ne mena mais si fait usage,","ever behaved in such a way,","ever manifest such a usage,",
2557,nor will I lead it any longer:,Ne jo plus longhes nel menrai:,nor wil[l] I do so any longer!,nor will I manifest one any longer:,
2558,I will adopt the behavior of a woman.,A us de feme me tenrai.,I will keep to women’s ways.,I will handle myself as a woman customarily does.,
2559,"I do not want to cut my hair short,","Jo ne voel pas moi estalcier,","I won’t cut my hair short any more,","I do not want to cut my hair short,",
2560,"disguise my clothing, wear breeches,","Fendre mes dras, braies calcier,",wear slit garments and breeches,"to rip my clothes, to burn my breeches,",
2561,"nor live like a boy any more,","Ne mais vivre a fuer de garçon,",And live like a boy,"or live in the manner of a boy,",I want to play with manner/manor here.
2562,hunting with bow and quiver.,"Prendre mon coivre, et mon arçon.",with bow and quiver.,with my quiver and my bow.,"""Arçon"" presents many possible interconnected meanings (certainly some sexual innuendos) including ""bow"" as in ""bow and arrow"" or for a musical instrument. ""Arçon"" can also refer to various arcs including the arc of a yoke or the arc of a saddle. And finally ""estre ou monter es arçons"" means to ""faire l'amour"", and ""perdre (les) arçons"" refers to falling from one's horse."
2563,"It never happened to any woman,",Avint adonques mais a nule?,Did anything like this ever happen to anyone?,,
2564,ever! And when I get dressed,Nenil! adunc quant jo m’afule,"Never! Now, when I get dressed,",,
2565,to withdraw from some game,Por moi de tel giu a retraire,and don’t participate,,
2566,"such as boys often play,","Com vallet suelent encor faire, /","in the kinds of games that boys are used to,",,
2567,"then all my companions say,",Dont dient tuit mi compagnon:,"all my companions jeer,",,
