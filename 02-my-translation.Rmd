# A New Translation of verses 2439-2688

My translation attempts to account for the polysemous words in this passage of _Silence_. Where appropriate, I have taken etymologies into account. I welcome the reader's comments to improve this project.

```{r}
df_translations_mine <- df_translations %>% 
    select(Line, `Roche-Mahdi (2007) OF Edition`, `My Translation`, Notes) %>%
  mutate(
    #convert notes to margin notes (only when there is something in the Notes column, otherwise leave blank)
    Notes = case_when(
      Notes != "" ~ margin_note(Notes),
      TRUE ~ ""
      ),
    #paste the margin notes to the last column
    `My Translation` = paste(`My Translation`, Notes)) %>% 
  #remove notes column
  select(-Notes)

kable(df_translations_mine, 
      # caption = "Here's a caption", 
      #escape = FALSE needed so explicit HTML in table will render as HTML
      escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, width = "6cm")

```
