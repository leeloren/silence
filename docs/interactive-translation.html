had learned enough","to understand that he was a girl,","his father had a talk with him,","and told him the reason","they concealed and hid him.","“If King Ebain knew what","we have done with you, dear son,","your portion of what we have on earth","would be very small indeed;","for the king, fair son, has disinherited","all the women in England,","all because of a war","between two counts who died","Because of two twins who lived then.","Fair dear son, it is not for ourselves","that we do this; it is for you.","You now know the entire reason, son.","As you hold our honor dear,","conceal yourself from everyone.”","And the child answered sweetly","and quickly, like a good child:","“Do not fear anything at all,","for if it please God I will indeed","conceal myself from everyone.”","His father admonished him often,","and so did his mother,","the seneschal, and the nurse.","Everyone urged him to do right.","He possessed such understanding","that he believed their instruction fully.","The seneschal, to improve the child","and to teach him to ride,","took him to the woods and streams,","of which there were many in that country.","He took him most often out in the sun,","to make him look more like a boy.","The child was so used to masculine ways,","and had so refused the feminine,","that he very nearly was a boy;","what could be seen of him was entirely male.","But he had other than masculine qualities in his makeup,","for he was, beneath his clothes, a girl.","In the early years the seneschal","guarded him well, above all things.","The more the child grew in size,","the more his abilities improved.","When one cannot commit folly,","why should anyone restrain him?","The fact that he feared to lose his birthright","made him stick even closer to wisdom.","His own heart taught him","to avoid foolish behavior.","Thus he had sufficient inclination,","and by the time he was eleven,","there was no one more adept than he:","when they played at jousting,","at tilting, or at swords,","he alone made all his peers tremble.","Silence improved at these immensely,","for his heart taught him","to do so for concealment’s sake.","After twelve years, Nature came to him,","talking with him and reproaching him sternly.","She told him, “Here is a strange thing,","that you behave like a boy,","going out in the wind and the sun,","when I had a special mold from which","I formed you with my own two hands.","And the beauty I saved up for so long","I concentrated all in you.","A thousand people consider me stingy","in beauty, of which you are full;","for I withheld beauty from a thousand others,","which I used to make you.","There are a thousand women in this life","who will greatly desire you","for the beauty they will see in you,","and because they will think to find in you","something that is not there at all.","And one woman may be your good friend now,","who would hate you with all her heart","if she knew your real nature;","for she would consider herself deceived","because her hope failed.","Certainly you do me great wrong","when you follow such an upbringing.","You must not travel the woods,","throw, or shoot, or hunt.","Get away from here!” said Nature.","“Stay in the side-chambers,","for nature demands this!","You are not Silentius!”","He answered, “I never heard such a thing!","Silentius! Who am I then?","My name is Silentius, I think,","or I am someone else than I was.","But this I know well, by my right hand,","that I cannot be any other!","So I am Silentius,","it seems to me, or I am no one.”","He thought to himself","that Nature was speaking in sophistries;","because the -us was against natural law,","his name was not Silentius.","He wanted to stay in the chamber","as Nature had entreated him to,","because neither for a fief nor an inheritance","should he keep up such a barbarous usage.","At this point Nurture arrived,","and saw Silence speaking to Nature.","She asked him, “Whatever are you doing here?”","He answered, “Nature is quarreling with me.","And in faith, it is not wrong","for her to show me and acquaint me with","the usage that is lawful,","for this one is not natural.","Truly, no woman of my lineage","ever led such a life as this,","nor will I lead it any longer:","I will adopt the behavior of a woman.","I do not want to cut my hair short,","disguise my clothing, wear breeches,","nor live like a boy any more,","hunting with bow and quiver.","It never happened to any woman,","ever! And when I get dressed","to withdraw from some game","such as boys often play,","then all my companions say,","‘This one will have a treacherous heart,","if he lives long here and now.’","But they don’t know how it is with me.","If my garment opens by chance","I’m afraid my sex will show.","I want to act differently now.","I used to frequent the court;","but all this I have put behind me,","and will live in peace.","The Almighty Who gave me life","can take care of me and feed me:","for have I not heard it said","that He is of such great goodness","that He gives to all His creatures","what their natures need?","Was ever a woman so tormented","and deceived by base treachery?","To act out of greed","I cannot tolerate in any way.”","When Nurture heard this,","do you think she was happy about it?","Not at all! Indeed, she shuddered and raged.","She got angry with Nature","and looked at her bitterly.","Then she told her very harshly,","“Curse you, Nature,","leave my nursling alone.","I have completely denatured her.","She will never succumb to you.","If you do not leave off these visits","you will be able to boast only","that through environment I can make","a thousand people work against nature.","All in all, I easily train","a noble child into a bad man.","I will undo all your speech.","Nature, begone, and take the child’s shame away with you.”","When Nature had gone away,","descending the rock where","Nurture had so argued,","behold the struggle begun again","over Silence: for Reason","showed her and told him why","it would be very nearly death to him","to study and desire","to abandon his upbringing","in order to do as Nature wished:","“Believe my advice, friend Silence,","and embrace abstinence.","Make your heart a fortress.","If Nature, who torments you now,","takes you to her, in truth","You will never be a boy again.","You will lose both horse and cart.","Do not think that the king will give you","your fief for having lied,","if he perceives your true nature.”","Reason stayed with him","And admonished him until","Silence understood clearly","that he had believed foolish advice","when he considered putting off","and denying his good old custom","to take up that of a woman.","Then he began to remember","the games people play in private,","which he had often heard described,","and he weighed in his heart","the woman’s role against his own,","and saw that a man’s life is better","than a woman’s, all things considered.","“Truly,” he said, “in an evil hour","will I go underneath, when I am on top.","I am on top now, and I would have to go beneath.","Now I am most valorous and strong,","but I wouldn’t be any longer; rather, in faith,","I’d be shamed if I wanted to be like the women.","I thought of it for my own pleasure.","I have a mouth too hard for kissing,","and arms too rough for embracing.","I would quickly be beaten","at the game people play under the covers,","for I am a boy, and not a girl at all.","I don’t want to lose my great honor,","nor exchange it for a lesser one.","I don’t want to give the lie to my father;","may God let me suffer death sooner.","No matter what Nature can do","I will not reveal my

Here we see a connection between raising Silence as a boy and his family's ability to protect the inheritance of their lands. There is another apparent play on words between \"cuevre\" meaning \"a quiver\" and \"cuivriier\" (to torment), \"covrir\" (to cover)."," "," "," ","\"Portion\" feels like the best word choice to me here because it recalls the Biblical theme of one's \"portion\" granted by God, which Silence will reference later in this passage."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","\"Cover\" here has the message of shielding oneself from harm.

The playing on cover/discover will be important later."," ","\"Fuer\" having the dual meaning of \"price\"/\"rate\" or \"manner\"/fashion\" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. \"Disposition\" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like \"refined\" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is \"refined\" as in \"educated\" and \"refined\" as in \"processed\" goods.","\"Cremer\" can mean \"bruler, embraser\" or \"craindre\", so I've gone a bit informal here with \"sweat it\" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly \"sweat\" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text."," "," ","This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in \"chastise\"/\"chasten\" or \"to make pure, chaste\". Silence will be able to live as a \"man\" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb \"castier\" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb \"chastrer\" meaning \"to castrate.\""," "," ","The etymology of this word \"entice\" includes a connotation of flames from the Latin \"titio\" for \"firebrand\", \"set on fire\", \"to fan the flames of\", \"to encourage.\" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat since Silence is changed with the exposure to the sun, but I've gone with \"incite\" because of its negative connotations. I see some humor in this verse as they are perhaps encouraging Silence to do the wrong thing but to do it well.","I feel like Silence's choice in all of this has been somewhat downplayed. Silence proves him/herself capable of making choices, and clearly so many people would not be trying to reason with him/her if it weren't for the fear that (s)he would disobey their wishes."," "," "," ","I chose this verb \"maneuvered\" to reflect how the original word \"maine\" has the word \"main\" as in \"hand\" in it and to reflect how the seneschal is physically reshaping Silence. Plus, the word \"maneuver\" has the connotation of a military exercise, which is kind of what Silence is being trained for as (s)he gains knightly skills."," "," ","One could simply interpret this word \"violt\" as \"voloir\", but other obliquely related words come to mind as well. From \"voielete\" as in \"sentier\" in Modern French (\"path\" in English), and the word also brings to mind the verb \"vïoler\" meaning either \"to play the viol\" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or \"to dishonor\"/\"to take by force\"/\"to violate\". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated."," "," "," ","I like \"quite\" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of \"quite\" differently as meaning either \"very much\" or only \"somewhat\".","The original verse is an old idiom literally reading \"(S)he had in the bucket something other than flour.\" The ambiguity of \"El\" sounding like the pronoun \"Elle\" has been commented on by others. This idiom is playing on Silence being crafted by others, and the image of baking is especially relevant for the later appearance of Nature who is often described as forming beings through baking or forging. I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the English idiom I've provided here conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing."," "," "," ","My translation emphasizes Silence's growth in size as well as status.","\"Destrece\" (and its English equivalent \"distress\") carries the connotations of both physical and financial hardship. As a legal term \"distress\" specifically refers to the seizure of property, which is the threat looming over Silence here.","\"Ataindre\" can have the connotation of parentage, so I almost translated it to \"engender\", but that felt a bit too on the nose."," "," ","I see some irony in this verse as Silence's family is securing his \"rights\" while restricting his movements."," ","I chose the verb \"renounce\" because of how it can be used to decline a role or position. Silence is forced to adopt one role while turning down another.","I'm playing here with the earlier references to horseback riding. With the given \"lassor\" (also spelled \"laissor\" or \"loisir\"), I also see the Old French verb \"laissier,\" which can mean \"to let run on a slack lead.\" Silence may have a long leash, but (s)he is still bridled. I also like the English pun of \"rein\" and \"reign\" that ties in the issue of social class and inheritance."," ","I think it's important to keep the word \"master\" here as Silence is being raised to be a young noble boy or \"master\" as (s)he masters these masculine skills."," "," ","\"Quiver\" as in the noun appears several times in this narrative, and one might \"quiver\" with fear, pleasure, and anticipation. All of this physical contact with the other boys might have provoked the same effect Silence will later have on the King of France."," "," ","I like \"sham\" here because it conveys both a deception and a covering as in a pillow sham. Silence must remain undercover, and that deceit causes him/her to feel shame."," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","I am using \"seal\" in Nature's speech because it combines the actions of storing and concealing (as one might in a cellar) with the sealing of a legal agreement. Maintaining Silence's body as male is what seals the deal of her inheritance. This also supports Nature's use of the word \"scel\" in verse 2516."," "," ","\"Farse\" (or \"farce\") can refer to an absurdity, or in a culinary sense, it can also refer to stuffing. Here we can see a double meaning as Nature sees Silence making a mockery of her own substance so carefully prepared by Nature."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","My use of \"lot\" here is meant to convey the multiple meanings of \"fuer\", which can refer to the price or amount of something as well as to a person's disposition (in this passage alone see also verses 2459, 2503, 2561). \"Lot\" also conveys how Silence's identity as a man is meant to secure a plot of land.","Reading around this word \"malballie\" lends itself to some possibilities for sexual innuendo. For example in \"malbaillir\", we have the verb \"baillier\" meaning \"céder la jouissance ou l'exploitation d'un bien pour un prix et une durée fixés par contrat\", and from there we can see \"bailliee\" which refers to \"permission de prendre du bois\".","This hypothetical scenario set forward by Nature is almost certainly foreshadowing Eufeme's later attempts on Silence who will herself describe their encounter in economic terms (see verses 3884-8).","The Matsumura dictionary also offers \"parties génitales\" as a possible use for the word \"laidure.\" It may be that Nature is specifically referring to the misuse of her handiwork in that department."," ","\"Converser\" can mean \"demeurer,\" \"fréquenter,\" \"avoir des rapports,\" or \"avoir des relations charnelles\"."," "," ","We have again a possible double entendre as \"costure\" can refer to sewing or the cultivation of land (a common metaphor for reproduction). I invite the English reader to hear sew/sow in this verse.","Here again we can see desired paths for Silence (see also verses 2474, 2543, and 2614 in this passage). I have pulled this verse out of Nature's speech and given it to the narrator because it feels more natural as an interjected observation coming from the narrator."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","Many have called attention to this word \"nus\" as implying nudity as well as negation. I have rendered it as \"nobody\" to call attention to Silence's body, which will be made nude at the end of the narrative."," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","Pushing against both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi, I do not think Silence has been convinced by Nature so quickly. In this section, I see Silence mulling over Nature's suggestions without fully accepting them, especially since Nature's discourse is referred to as \"sofime\" (v. 2540)."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","I want to play with the homophones \"manner\" and \"manor\" here.","\"Arçon\" presents many possible interconnected meanings (certainly some sexual innuendos) including \"bow\" as in \"bow and arrow\" or for a musical instrument. \"Arçon\" can also refer to various arcs including the arc of a yoke or the arc of a saddle. And finally \"estre ou monter es arçons\" means to \"faire l'amour\", and \"perdre (les) arçons\" refers to falling from one's horse."," "," ","Godefroy writes that the word \"giu\" (meaning \"jeu\") \"s'employait souvent pour désigner l'acte amoureux\".","The word \"suelent\" is giving me a lot of trouble. Thorpe, Psaki, and Rochd-Mahdi do not offer guidance on it. In Godefroy, I find the verb \"sueller\" as in \"mettre un seuil à, achever jusqu'au seuil.\" Are these amorous games played when young men cross thresholds?"," "," "," "," ","The Matsumura dictionary includes \"par exemple\" as a possible interpretation of \"par aventure\". Here I do not see Silence being afraid of being seen nude exactly. Rather, I see Silence feeling anxiety about the fact that his/her \"nature\" changes simply by the act of undressing."," "," ","See verse 2525 for another use of \"converser.\" This connection would seem to compare the woods and the court as similarly wild spaces."," "," "," "," ","My translation is a bit silly here, but \"queles\" or \"chaëles\" is an interjection of exasperation similar to \"For Heaven's sake!\" But also, \"chaële\" is the diminutive for a dog. Thorpe gives \"Que\" and says \"This line is hardly legible,\" so without access to the manuscript, I will take some liberties."," "," "," ","\"Tanee\" can mean both \"tanned\" and \"tormented\". I kept tanned because the text spends a lot of time describing the tanning of Silence's skin. Plus to \"tan someone's hide\" is to punish them similar to the way Silence is being physically corrected by his/her guardians, and \"tanning\" may be another reference to the craftwork performed on Silence's body by the hands of Nurture.","With \"engineered\" I'm connecting \"engan\", which only refers to \"tromperie\", with \"engin\" which can refer to \"tromperie\" as well as \"ingéniosité\". Silence has been fooled and engineered by disingenuous actors. For \"barat\" (meaning \"commerce,\" \"agitation/confusion,\" \"tromperie,\" or \"voleur\"), we also have the verb \"barater\" meaning \"battre le crème dans une baratte,\" and \"churning\" is a term that can be used to refer to a type of financial securities fraud. This may be a big stretch on my part, but it's fun to make words work overtime."," ","The word \"guise\" can be easily translated to English as \"guise\", but in Old/Middle French with the alternative spellings \"guige\" or \"guiche\", this word can also refer to a \"courroie qui sert à porter l'écu, le cor, etc.\" or a \"bande servant de cache-sexe.\" In one word, we have connotations of heraldry, genitals, and dissimulation."," "," "," ","With \"caustic\" I'm trying to pull in the double meaning of sarcastic/angry and corrosive, which is related etymologically with \"corrocier\"."," "," "," "," ","It's interesting that Nurture refers to Silence in the feminine form considering Nurture is trying to reform Silence into a young man. Note the feminine ending used here for \"desnaturee\" and \"duree\" in the next verse."," "," "," "," "," "," ","I've chosen \"unwholesome\" to communicate both physical and moral deficiency but also to convey Silence's incompleteness.","We might see \"conte\" implying both a quantity and a narrative here."," "," "," "," ","\"Estor\" can be a \"tournoi\" or a \"combat\" as previous translations interpret it, but \"estor\" is also \"équipement\" or \"provisions\" and is the etymological origin of the English word \"store.\" I see Nurture and Reason here taking back their project from Nature.","By interpreting \"seur\" here as \"sure\" rather than \"over\" (as in \"sur\" in Modern French), Silence can be seen as a more active participant in this dialogue. This argument is about Silence, but importantly, it is Silence who must be convinced here.","Silence's father gives only one \"oquoison\" (see verses 2442, 2450, & 2455): King Ebain's disinheritance of all English women, but Reason provides Silence with other more personal \"oquoisons\" including the benefits of leading a masculine identity."," ","See verse 2552 for a repeat of this phrasing.","See verse 2490 for a repeat of this verb."," "," "," ","I would love to find a word that factored in the \"fierté\" meaning of \"ferté\" as well."," "," "," "," "," "," ","Both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi use the phrase \"true nature\" here, but that \"true\" is a modern insertion that I think goes too far to suggest that Silence's nature can be so easily determined."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","I wonder why the spelling of \"giu\" has changed here to \"jus\"? Compare with verses 2565 and 2649. Is this a play on the pronoun \"je\" which along with other variants can be spelled \"ju\" or \"jo\" as we see elsewhere in this passage? Is the author suggesting that these games are exercises that create gendered \"jus\"?","Note how the narrator also uses this verb \"retraire\" when discussing boys games earlier in this passage. See verse 2565."," "," "," "," ","With the exclamation \"voire\", Silence means to say \"truly\" or \"indeed\" (and not the command \"look\") as Psaki and Roche-Mahdi have respectively translated this verse, but in contemporary English, \"look\" is often used to draw attention to a point someone is trying to make. By translating this word as \"look\", we can see Silence as asserting his/her own point of view rather than being passively swayed by the admonishments of others.","I'm trying to use \"bottom\" and \"top\" here in the sense of queer slang to combine Silence's sexual/gender role with his position in the social hierarchy. I'm sure this double entendre has been clear to readers for a long time, but leaning into this lingo makes the verse smoother in translation I think."," "," "," "," "," "," ","There is a lot that can be done with this verse. First, the verb \"acoler\" can refer to any embrace about the neck, but here I find especially apt the use of \"acoler\" in the process of being knighted. I have tried to accommodate both amorous embraces and knighthood with \"accolades\", but I think more can be done there. Then, the adjective \"rois\" can mean \"dur\"/\"ferme,\" \"impétueux\"/\"violent,\" \"rudement,\" and I feel like there must be a pun here on \"king\" as well. I've gone with \"raw\" to refer to Silence's body as still being in development. I see Silence lamenting his/her liminal position as she is too hard for lovemaking and he is too fresh for knighthood."," ","Although \"gordine\" (or \"cortine\") can refer to the \"couverture\" or the \"rideau qui entoure un lit\", I've decided to go with curtains for two reasons: 1.) to distinguish this word from the others the author uses to play with covering/uncovering literally and metaphorically and 2.) to call extra attention to the sexual innuendo here. The Godefroy dicitonary lists \"gordine\" as a \"femme galante, femme de mauvaise vie.\" Plus, the vulva is often described as having \"curtains.\""," "," ","I've gone with \"touch\" for \"tangier\" here. \"Tangier\" does not seem to appear in any of my reference texts, but I imagine it comes from the Latin \"tangere\" (\"to touch\") as \"tangible\" or \"tangent.\""," "," "," ","Both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi translate the \"en\" in this verse as \"my/the secret,\" but I prefer to keep the referent for \"en\" more ambiguous."," "," "," "," "," "," ","These verses from the narrator are a bit awkward, but some have commented on Heldris the author as often seeming deliberately verbose and grandiose perhaps to subdue his authority as narrator and add humor to the text.

The playing on cover/discover will be important later.<\/span>","","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2459\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2459\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Fuer\" having the dual meaning of \"price\"/\"rate\" or \"manner\"/fashion\" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. \"Disposition\" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like \"refined\" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is \"refined\" as in \"educated\" and \"refined\" as in \"processed\" goods.<\/span>","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2460\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2460\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Cremer\" can mean \"bruler, embraser\" or \"craindre\", so I've gone a bit informal here with \"sweat it\" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly \"sweat\" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text.<\/span>","","","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2463\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2463\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in \"chastise\"/\"chasten\" or \"to make pure, chaste\". Silence will be able to live as a \"man\" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb \"castier\" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb \"chastrer\" meaning \"to castrate.\"<\/span>","","","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2466\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2466\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The etymology of this word \"entice\" includes a connotation of flames from the Latin \"titio\" for \"firebrand\", \"set on fire\", \"to fan the flames of\", \"to encourage.\" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat since Silence is changed with the exposure to the sun, but I've gone with \"incite\" because of its negative connotations.

From \"voielete\" as in \"sentier\" in Modern French (\"path\" in English), and the word also brings to mind the verb \"vïoler\" meaning either \"to play the viol\" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or \"to dishonor\"/\"to take by force\"/\"to violate\". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated.<\/span>","","","","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2478\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2478\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I like \"quite\" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of \"quite\" differently as meaning either \"very much\" or only \"somewhat\".<\/span>","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2479\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2479\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The original verse is an old idiom literally reading \"(S)he had in the bucket something other than flour.\" The ambiguity of \"El\" sounding like the pronoun \"Elle\" has been commented on by others. This idiom is playing on Silence being crafted by others, and the image of baking is especially relevant for the later appearance of Nature who is often described as forming beings through baking or forging. I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the English idiom I've provided here conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing.<\/span>","","","","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2483\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2483\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> My translation emphasizes Silence's growth in size as well as status.<\/span>","<label for=\"tufte-mn-2484\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2484\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Destrece\" (and its English equivalent \"distress\") carries the connotations of both physical and financial hardship.

First, the verb \"acoler\" can refer to any embrace about the neck, but here I find especially apt the use of \"acoler\" in the process of being knighted. I have tried to accommodate both amorous embraces and knighthood with \"accolades\", but I think more can be done there. Then, the adjective \"rois\" can mean \"dur\"/\"ferme,\" \"impétueux\"/\"violent,\" \"rudement,\" and I feel like there must be a pun here on \"king\" as well. I've gone with \"raw\" to refer to Silence's body as still being in development.

There is another apparent play on words between \"cuevre\" meaning \"a quiver\" and \"cuivriier\" (to torment), \"covrir\" (to cover).<\/span>","“If the king Ebain knew the creation ","that we are making of you, fair son, ","of all that we have under heaven ","your portion would be small; <label for=\"tufte-mn-2447\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2447\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Portion\" feels like the best word choice to me here because it recalls the Biblical theme of one's \"portion\" granted by God, which Silence will reference later in this passage.<\/span>","for the king, fair son, disinherited ","all the women of England, ","all because of a war ","between two counts who died in it ","for two twins with whom they were bound. ","Fair sweet dear son, it is not for us ","that we do so, rather it is for you. ","The whole cause, son, you know. ","As dearly as you hold honor, ","just so, you will cover yourself from everyone.” <label for=\"tufte-mn-2457\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2457\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Cover\" here has the message of shielding oneself from harm. In this way, honor is made out to be a sort of shield one wears for self-protection, and Silence must use both honor and clothing to conceal identity and remain safe from harm. The playing on cover/discover will be important later.<\/span>","And this [child] responded so sweetly, ","briefly, with the disposition of a refined child: <label for=\"tufte-mn-2459\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2459\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Fuer\" having the dual meaning of \"price\"/\"rate\" or \"manner\"/fashion\" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. \"Disposition\" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like \"refined\" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is \"refined\" as in \"educated\" and \"refined\" as in \"processed\" goods.<\/span>","“Don’t sweat it one bit. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2460\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2460\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Cremer\" can mean \"bruler, embraser\" or \"craindre\", so I've gone a bit informal here with \"sweat it\" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly \"sweat\" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text.<\/span>","For, so help me God, I’ll do it. ","I will cover myself from everyone.” ","The father often chastised him well, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2463\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2463\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in \"chastise\"/\"chasten\" or \"to make pure, chaste\". Silence will be able to live as a \"man\" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb \"castier\" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb \"chastrer\" meaning \"to castrate.\"<\/span>","And often so did the mother, ","the seneschal, and the nurse. ","Each incited him to do well. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2466\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2466\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The etymology of this word \"entice\" includes a connotation of flames from the Latin \"titio\" for \"firebrand\", \"set on fire\", \"to fan the flames of\", \"to encourage.\" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat since Silence is changed with the exposure to the sun, but I've gone with \"incite\" because of its negative connotations. I see some humor in this verse as they are perhaps encouraging Silence to do the wrong thing but to do it well.<\/span>","He has such an intention <label for=\"tufte-mn-2467\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2467\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I feel like Silence's choice in all of this has been somewhat downplayed. Silence proves him/herself capable of making choices, and clearly so many people would not be trying to reason with him/her if it weren't for the fear that (s)he would disobey their wishes.<\/span>","that he had faith in their chastisement. ","The seneschal, to raise [him] in honor ","and to teach [him] to ride ","maneuvered him through woods and through streams <label for=\"tufte-mn-2471\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2471\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I chose this verb \"maneuvered\" to reflect how the original word \"maine\" has the word \"main\" as in \"hand\" in it and to reflect how the seneschal is physically reshaping Silence. Plus, the word \"maneuver\" has the connotation of a military exercise, which is kind of what Silence is being trained for as (s)he gains knightly skills.<\/span>","which were rather plentiful in the land. ","He maneuvered him so very often in the broiling sun ","so that such a beaten path might make [him] more male. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2474\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2474\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> One could simply interpret this word \"violt\" as \"voloir\", but other obliquely related words come to mind as well. From \"voielete\" as in \"sentier\" in Modern French (\"path\" in English), and the word also brings to mind the verb \"vïoler\" meaning either \"to play the viol\" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or \"to dishonor\"/\"to take by force\"/\"to violate\". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated.<\/span>","He was so used to men’s customs ","and had refused those of women ","that little was lacking for him to be male: ","All that one saw of him was quite male. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2478\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2478\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I like \"quite\" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of \"quite\" differently as meaning either \"very much\" or only \"somewhat\".<\/span>","But one cannot judge a book by its cover: <label for=\"tufte-mn-2479\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2479\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The original verse is an old idiom literally reading \"(S)he had in the bucket something other than flour.\" The ambiguity of \"El\" sounding like the pronoun \"Elle\" has been commented on by others. This idiom is playing on Silence being crafted by others, and the image of baking is especially relevant for the later appearance of Nature who is often described as forming beings through baking or forging. I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the English idiom I've provided here conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing.<\/span>","Under the covers, he was a girl. ","The seneschal, against all else ","in the early years, kept watch over him. ","As the child grew in stature, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2483\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2483\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> My translation emphasizes Silence's growth in size as well as status.<\/span>","so the more diminished his distress. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2484\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2484\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Destrece\" (and its English equivalent \"distress\") carries the connotations of both physical and financial hardship. As a legal term \"distress\" specifically refers to the seizure of property, which is the threat looming over Silence here.<\/span>","Since he couldn’t give rise to trouble there, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2485\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2485\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Ataindre\" can have the connotation of parentage, so I almost translated it to \"engender\", but that felt a bit too on the nose.<\/span>","why should anyone hold him back? ","Since they feared losing his rights, ","that fact taught him to adhere even more. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2488\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2488\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I see some irony in this verse as Silence's family is securing his \"rights\" while restricting his movements.<\/span>","His own heart schooled him ","to renounce foolish manners. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2490\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2490\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I chose the verb \"renounce\" because of how it can be used to decline a role or position. Silence is forced to adopt one role while turning down another.<\/span>","Because of this, he had free rein. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2491\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2491\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I'm playing here with the earlier references to horseback riding. With the given \"lassor\" (also spelled \"laissor\" or \"loisir\"), I also see the Old French verb \"laissier,\" which can mean \"to let run on a slack lead.\" Silence may have a long leash, but (s)he is still bridled. I also like the English pun of \"rein\" and \"reign\" that ties in the issue of social class and inheritance.<\/span>","And when he had passed eleven years [of age], ","there was not a one more masterly than he. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2493\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2493\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I think it's important to keep the word \"master\" here as Silence is being raised to be a young noble boy or \"master\" as (s)he masters these masculine skills.<\/span>","When they played at wrestling, ","at jousting, or at fencing, ","he alone made all of his peers quiver. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2496\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2496\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Quiver\" as in the noun appears several times in this narrative, and one might \"quiver\" with fear, pleasure, and anticipation. All of this physical contact with the other boys might have provoked the same effect Silence will later have on the King of France.<\/span>","They made Silence exasperated with himself ","for his heart told him ","that what he was doing was a sham. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2499\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2499\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I like \"sham\" here because it conveys both a deception and a covering as in a pillow sham. Silence must remain undercover, and that deceit causes him/her to feel shame.<\/span>","After twelve years, then came Nature ","who condemned and complained about their making of her. ","She said to him: “What a strange case, ","that you play at being a male, ","and go out in the wind and the broiling sun, ","when I had a special frame ","with which I formed you with my [own] two hands. ","And the beauty that I had so sealed away <label for=\"tufte-mn-2507\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2507\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I am using \"seal\" in Nature's speech because it combines the actions of storing and concealing (as one might in a cellar) with the sealing of a legal agreement. Maintaining Silence's body as male is what seals the deal of her inheritance. This also supports Nature's use of the word \"scel\" in verse 2516.<\/span>","all of it I had accumulated in you. ","A thousand people take me for a miser ","for the beauty I stuffed you with; <label for=\"tufte-mn-2510\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2510\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Farse\" (or \"farce\") can refer to an absurdity, or in a culinary sense, it can also refer to stuffing. Here we can see a double meaning as Nature sees Silence making a mockery of her own substance so carefully prepared by Nature.<\/span>","for I retained from a thousand people ","the beauty with which you remain. ","There are a thousand women in this life ","who covet you so greatly ","for the beauty that they see in you; ","for they believe there may be sealed there ","a certain something that you don’t have at all. ","And some woman who might love you so much now ","who would harass you with all her heart, ","if she knew about your lot... <label for=\"tufte-mn-2520\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2520\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> My use of \"lot\" here is meant to convey the multiple meanings of \"fuer\", which can refer to the price or amount of something as well as to a person's disposition (in this passage alone see also verses 2459, 2503, 2561). \"Lot\" also conveys how Silence's identity as a man is meant to secure a plot of land.<\/span>","for in this she would count herself maltreated for it; <label for=\"tufte-mn-2521\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2521\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Reading around this word \"malballie\" lends itself to some possibilities for sexual innuendo. For example in \"malbaillir\", we have the verb \"baillier\" meaning \"céder la jouissance ou l'exploitation d'un bien pour un prix et une durée fixés par contrat\", and from there we can see \"bailliee\" which refers to \"permission de prendre du bois\".<\/span>","she and her aspirations would be crestfallen. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2522\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2522\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> This hypothetical scenario set forward by Nature is almost certainly foreshadowing Eufeme's later attempts on Silence who will herself describe their encounter in economic terms (see verses 3884-8).<\/span>","You do me, to be sure, an ugly thing <label for=\"tufte-mn-2523\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2523\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The Matsumura dictionary also offers \"parties génitales\" as a possible use for the word \"laidure.\" It may be that Nature is specifically referring to the misuse of her handiwork in that department.<\/span>","when you maintain such nurturing. ","You should not be out in the woods cavorting, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2525\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2525\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Converser\" can mean \"demeurer,\" \"fréquenter,\" \"avoir des rapports,\" or \"avoir des relations charnelles\".<\/span>","lancing, nor traipsing, nor shooting. ","Get yourself out of here!” so said Nature.

I invite the English reader to hear sew/sow in this verse.<\/span>","This is Nature’s path, custom for him. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2529\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2529\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Here again we can see desired paths for Silence (see also verses 2474, 2543, and 2614 in this passage). I have pulled this verse out of Nature's speech and given it to the narrator because it feels more natural as an interjected observation coming from the narrator.<\/span>","“You are not Silentius!” ","And this [child] responded: “I never heard such a thing!

In this section, I see Silence mulling over Nature's suggestions without fully accepting them, especially since Nature's discourse is referred to as \"sofime\" (v. 2540).<\/span>","Suddenly there came Nurture ","who saw that he was talking to Nature.

Thorpe, Psaki, and Rochd-Mahdi do not offer guidance on it. In Godefroy, I find the verb \"sueller\" as in \"mettre un seuil à, achever jusqu'au seuil.\" Are these amorous games played when young men cross thresholds?<\/span>","Then, all my companions will say: ","“This one will have quite the underhanded heart ","if he lives that long.” ","But they don’t know how it is with me.

Here I do not see Silence being afraid of being seen nude exactly. Rather, I see Silence feeling anxiety about the fact that his/her \"nature\" changes simply by the act of undressing.<\/span>","I’m afraid of my nature. ","I experience pleasure so differently.

I kept tanned because the text spends a lot of time describing the tanning of Silence's skin. Plus to \"tan someone's hide\" is to punish them similar to the way Silence is being physically corrected by his/her guardians, and \"tanning\" may be another reference to the craftwork performed on Silence's body by the hands of Nurture.<\/span>","or engineered by such vile churning, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2584\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2584\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> With \"engineered\" I'm connecting \"engan\", which only refers to \"tromperie\", with \"engin\" which can refer to \"tromperie\" as well as \"ingéniosité\". Silence has been fooled and engineered by disingenuous actors. For \"barat\" (meaning \"commerce,\" \"agitation/confusion,\" \"tromperie,\" or \"voleur\"), we also have the verb \"barater\" meaning \"battre le crème dans une baratte,\" and \"churning\" is a term that can be used to refer to a type of financial securities fraud. This may be a big stretch on my part, but it's fun to make words work overtime.<\/span>","that she might act out of covetousness?

Compare with verses 2565 and 2649. Is this a play on the pronoun \"je\" which along with other variants can be spelled \"ju\" or \"jo\" as we see elsewhere in this passage? Is the author suggesting that these games are exercises that create gendered \"jus\"?<\/span>","of which he had often heard recounted, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2634\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2634\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Note how the narrator also uses this verb \"retraire\" when discussing boys games earlier in this passage. See verse 2565.<\/span>","and he weighed this in his heart ","all the customs of women against his usage, ","and he saw that the customs of men were worth more ","than the customs of women, that is the sum.

By translating this word as \"look\", we can see Silence as asserting his/her own point of view rather than being passively swayed by the admonishments of others.<\/span>","will I bottom, when I’m a top. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2640\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2640\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I'm trying to use \"bottom\" and \"top\" here in the sense of queer slang to combine Silence's sexual/gender role with his position in the social hierarchy. I'm sure this double entendre has been clear to readers for a long time, but leaning into this lingo makes the verse smoother in translation I think.<\/span>","I’m on top, am I going to bottom out? ","Now I am so valiant and proud. ","No I’m not, in faith; rather I’m ashamed. ","When I wanted to be one with the women, ","in that way I thought to put myself at ease.

First, the verb \"acoler\" can refer to any embrace about the neck, but here I find especially apt the use of \"acoler\" in the process of being knighted. I have tried to accommodate both amorous embraces and knighthood with \"accolades\", but I think more can be done there. Then, the adjective \"rois\" can mean \"dur\"/\"ferme,\" \"impétueux\"/\"violent,\" \"rudement,\" and I feel like there must be a pun here on \"king\" as well. I've gone with \"raw\" to refer to Silence's body as still being in development. I see Silence lamenting his/her liminal position as she is too hard for lovemaking and he is too fresh for knighthood.<\/span>","One could totally make a fool of me ","at the game one plays under the curtains, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2649\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2649\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Although \"gordine\" (or \"cortine\") can refer to the \"couverture\" or the \"rideau qui entoure un lit\", I've decided to go with curtains for two reasons: 1.) to distinguish this word from the others the author uses to play with covering/uncovering literally and metaphorically and 2.) to call extra attention to the sexual innuendo here. The Godefroy dicitonary lists \"gordine\" as a \"femme galante, femme de mauvaise vie.\" Plus, the vulva is often described as having \"curtains.\"<\/span>","for I am a boy and in no way a girl.

It is worth noting a potential play on words between \"cogitacïon\" meaning \"pensée\" and \"cognacïon\" meaning \"parentée.\"<\/span>","like a child of such breeding <label for=\"tufte-mn-2664\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2664\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I appreciate how \"breeding\" can accommodate both the act of reproduction and the good manners associated with the upper class. \"Natiön\" is working here in the same way.<\/span>","especially a child so tender ","who had to render such usage.

Here we see a connection between raising Silence as a boy and his family's ability to protect the inheritance of their lands. There is another apparent play on words between \"cuevre\" meaning \"a quiver\" and \"cuivriier\" (to torment), \"covrir\" (to cover).<\/span>","“If the king Ebain knew the creation ","that we of you, fair son, are making ","of all that we under heaven have ","your portion would be small; <label for=\"tufte-mn-2447\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2447\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Portion\" feels like the best word choice to me here because it recalls the Biblical theme of one's \"portion\" granted by God, which Silence will reference later in this passage.<\/span>","for the king, fair son, disinherited ","all the women of England, ","all because of a war ","between two counts who died in it ","for two twins with whom they were bound.

In this way, honor is made out to be a sort of shield one wears for self-protection, and Silence must use both honor and clothing to conceal identity and remain safe from harm. The playing on cover/discover will be important later.<\/span>","And this one responded so sweetly, ","briefly, with the disposition of a refined child: <label for=\"tufte-mn-2459\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2459\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Fuer\" having the dual meaning of \"price\"/\"rate\" or \"manner\"/fashion\" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. \"Disposition\" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like \"refined\" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is \"refined\" as in \"educated\" and \"refined\" as in \"processed\" goods.<\/span>","“Don’t sweat it one bit. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2460\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2460\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Cremer\" can mean \"bruler, embraser\" or \"craindre\", so I've gone a bit informal here with \"sweat it\" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly \"sweat\" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text.<\/span>","For, so help me God, I’ll do it. ","From everyone, I will cover myself.\" ","Often, he chastised him well the father <label for=\"tufte-mn-2463\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2463\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in \"chastise\"/\"chasten\" or \"to make pure, chaste\". Silence will be able to live as a \"man\" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb \"castier\" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb \"chastrer\" meaning \"to castrate.\"<\/span>","And so did often the mother, ","the seneschal, and the nurse. ","To do well each incited him. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2466\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2466\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The etymology of this word \"entice\" includes a connotation of flames from the Latin \"titio\" for \"firebrand\", \"set on fire\", \"to fan the flames of\", \"to encourage.\" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat since Silence is changed with the exposure to the sun, but I've gone with \"incite\" because of its negative connotations. I see some humor in this verse as they are perhaps encouraging Silence to do the wrong thing but to do it well.<\/span>","He has such an intention <label for=\"tufte-mn-2467\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2467\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I feel like Silence's choice in all of this has been somewhat downplayed. Silence proves him/herself capable of making choices, and clearly so many people would not be trying to reason with him/her if it weren't for the fear that (s)he would disobey their wishes.<\/span>","that he had faith in their chastisement. ","The seneschal, to raise [him] in honor ","and to teach [him] to ride ","maneuvered him through woods and through streams <label for=\"tufte-mn-2471\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2471\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I chose this verb \"maneuvered\" to reflect how the original word \"maine\" has the word \"main\" as in \"hand\" in it and to reflect how the seneschal is physically reshaping Silence. Plus, the word \"maneuver\" has the connotation of a military exercise, which is kind of what Silence is being trained for as (s)he gains knightly skills.<\/span>","which were in the land rather plentiful. ","He maneuvered him so very often in the broiling sun ","so that such a beaten path might make [him] more male. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2474\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2474\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> One could simply interpret this word \"violt\" as \"voloir\", but other obliquely related words come to mind as well. From \"voielete\" as in \"sentier\" in Modern French (\"path\" in English), and the word also brings to mind the verb \"vïoler\" meaning either \"to play the viol\" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or \"to dishonor\"/\"to take by force\"/\"to violate\". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated.<\/span>","He was to men's customs so used ","and those of women [so] refused ","that little was lacking for him to be male: ","All that one saw of him was quite male. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2478\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2478\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I like \"quite\" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of \"quite\" differently as meaning either \"very much\" or only \"somewhat\".<\/span>","[But] (S)he had in the bucket something other than flour: <label for=\"tufte-mn-2479\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2479\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The original verse is an old idiom literally reading \"(S)he had in the bucket something other than flour.\" The ambiguity of \"El\" sounding like the pronoun \"Elle\" has been commented on by others. This idiom is playing on Silence being crafted by others, and the image of baking is especially relevant for the later appearance of Nature who is often described as forming beings through baking or forging. I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the English idiom I've provided here conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing.<\/span>","He was, under the covers, a girl. ","The seneschal, against all else ","in the early years, kept watch over him.

As a legal term \"distress\" specifically refers to the seizure of property, which is the threat looming over Silence here.<\/span>","Since there he couldn't give rise to trouble, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2485\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2485\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Ataindre\" can have the connotation of parentage, so I almost translated it to \"engender\", but that felt a bit too on the nose.<\/span>","why should anyone hold him back? ","Since they feared losing his rights, ","that fact even more taught him to adhere <label for=\"tufte-mn-2488\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2488\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I see some irony in this verse as Silence's family is securing his \"rights\" while restricting his movements.<\/span>","His own heart schooled him ","to renounce foolish manners. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2490\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2490\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I chose the verb \"renounce\" because of how it can be used to decline a role or position. Silence is forced to adopt one role while turning down another.<\/span>","Because of this, he had free rein. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2491\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2491\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I'm playing here with the earlier references to horseback riding. With the given \"lassor\" (also spelled \"laissor\" or \"loisir\"), I also see the Old French verb \"laissier,\" which can mean \"to let run on a slack lead.\" Silence may have a long leash, but (s)he is still bridled. I also like the English pun of \"rein\" and \"reign\" that ties in the issue of social class and inheritance.<\/span>","And when he had eleven years passed, ","there was not a one more masterly than he. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2493\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2493\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I think it's important to keep the word \"master\" here as Silence is being raised to be a young noble boy or \"master\" as (s)he masters these masculine skills.<\/span>","When they played at wrestling, ","at jousting, or at fencing, ","he alone made all of his peers quiver. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2496\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2496\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Quiver\" as in the noun appears several times in this narrative, and one might \"quiver\" with fear, pleasure, and anticipation. All of this physical contact with the other boys might have provoked the same effect Silence will later have on the King of France.<\/span>","They made Silence exasperated with himself ","for his heart told him ","that what he was doing was a sham. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2499\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2499\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I like \"sham\" here because it conveys both a deception and a covering as in a pillow sham. Silence must remain undercover, and that deceit causes him/her to feel shame.<\/span>","After twelve years, then came Nature ","who condemned and complained about their making of her. ","She said to him: “What a strange case, ","that you play at being a male, ","and go out in the wind and the broiling sun, ","when I had a special frame ","which with my own two hands I formed you.

Maintaining Silence's body as male is what seals the deal of her inheritance. This also supports Nature's use of the word \"scel\" in verse 2516.<\/span>","all of it in you I had accumulated. ","A thousand people take me for a miser ","for the beauty I stuffed you with; <label for=\"tufte-mn-2510\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2510\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Farse\" (or \"farce\") can refer to an absurdity, or in a culinary sense, it can also refer to stuffing. Here we can see a double meaning as Nature sees Silence making a mockery of her own substance so carefully prepared by Nature.<\/span>","for I retained from a thousand people ","the beauty with which you remain. ","A thousand women there are in this life ","who covet you so greatly ","for the beauty that they see in you; ","for maybe sealed there is — they believe — ","a certain something that you don’t have at all.

For example in \"malbaillir\", we have the verb \"baillier\" meaning \"céder la jouissance ou l'exploitation d'un bien pour un prix et une durée fixés par contrat\", and from there we can see \"bailliee\" which refers to \"permission de prendre du bois\".<\/span>","she and her aspirations would be crestfallen. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2522\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2522\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> This hypothetical scenario set forward by Nature is almost certainly foreshadowing Eufeme's later attempts on Silence who will herself describe their encounter in economic terms (see verses 3884-8).<\/span>","You do me, to be sure, an ugly thing <label for=\"tufte-mn-2523\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2523\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> The Matsumura dictionary also offers \"parties génitales\" as a possible use for the word \"laidure.\" It may be that Nature is specifically referring to the misuse of her handiwork in that department.<\/span>","when you maintain such nurturing. ","You should not be out in the woods cavorting, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2525\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2525\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> \"Converser\" can mean \"demeurer,\" \"fréquenter,\" \"avoir des rapports,\" or \"avoir des relations charnelles\".<\/span>","lancing, nor traipsing, nor shooting. ","Get yourself out of here!” so said Nature.

I invite the English reader to hear sew/sow in this verse.<\/span>","This is Nature’s path, custom for him. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2529\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2529\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Here again we can see desired paths for Silence (see also verses 2474, 2543, and 2614 in this passage). I have pulled this verse out of Nature's speech and given it to the narrator because it feels more natural as an interjected observation coming from the narrator.<\/span>","“You are not Silentius!” ","And this one responded: \"Such a thing I have never heard! ","Silentius! Who am I then? ","I have the name Silentius, I thought, ","or I am somebody I wasn’t. ","But well I know, by my right, ","that I can’t be anybody else!

In this section, I see Silence mulling over Nature's suggestions without fully accepting them, especially since Nature's discourse is referred to as \"sofime\" (v. 2540).<\/span>","Suddenly there came Nurture ","who saw that he was talking to Nature.

And finally \"estre ou monter es arçons\" means to \"faire l'amour\", and \"perdre (les) arçons\" refers to falling from one's horse.<\/span>","Well, has such a thing ever come to pass for anybody?

Here I do not see Silence being afraid of being seen nude exactly. Rather, I see Silence feeling anxiety about the fact that his/her \"nature\" changes simply by the act of undressing.<\/span>","I’m afraid of my nature. ","I experience pleasure so differently.

I kept tanned because the text spends a lot of time describing the tanning of Silence's skin. Plus to \"tan someone's hide\" is to punish them similar to the way Silence is being physically corrected by his/her guardians, and \"tanning\" may be another reference to the craftwork performed on Silence's body by the hands of Nurture.<\/span>","by such vile churning, or engineered, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2584\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2584\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> With \"engineered\" I'm connecting \"engan\", which only refers to \"tromperie\", with \"engin\" which can refer to \"tromperie\" as well as \"ingéniosité\". Silence has been fooled and engineered by disingenuous actors. For \"barat\" (meaning \"commerce,\" \"agitation/confusion,\" \"tromperie,\" or \"voleur\"), we also have the verb \"barater\" meaning \"battre le crème dans une baratte,\" and \"churning\" is a term that can be used to refer to a type of financial securities fraud. This may be a big stretch on my part, but it's fun to make words work overtime.<\/span>","that she might act out of covetousness?

Compare with verses 2565 and 2649. Is this a play on the pronoun \"je\" which along with other variants can be spelled \"ju\" or \"jo\" as we see elsewhere in this passage? Is the author suggesting that these games are exercises that create gendered \"jus\"?<\/span>","of which he had heard often recounted, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2634\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2634\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Note how the narrator also uses this verb \"retraire\" when discussing boys games earlier in this passage.

By translating this word as \"look\", we can see Silence as asserting his/her own point of view rather than being passively swayed by the admonishments of others.<\/span>","will I bottom, when I’m a top. <label for=\"tufte-mn-2640\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2640\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> I'm trying to use \"bottom\" and \"top\" here in the sense of queer slang to combine Silence's sexual/gender role with his position in the social hierarchy. I'm sure this double entendre has been clear to readers for a long time, but leaning into this lingo makes the verse smoother in translation I think.<\/span>","I’m on top, am I going to bottom out? ","Now I am so valiant and proud. ","No I’m not, in faith; rather I’m ashamed. ","When I wanted to be one with the women, ","in that way I thought to put myself at ease.

First, the verb \"acoler\" can refer to any embrace about the neck, but here I find especially apt the use of \"acoler\" in the process of being knighted. I have tried to accommodate both amorous embraces and knighthood with \"accolades\", but I think more can be done there. Then, the adjective \"rois\" can mean \"dur\"/\"ferme,\" \"impétueux\"/\"violent,\" \"rudement,\" and I feel like there must be a pun here on \"king\" as well. I've gone with \"raw\" to refer to Silence's body as still being in development. I see Silence lamenting his/her liminal position as she is too hard for lovemaking and he is too fresh for knighthood.<\/span>","One could totally make a fool of me ","at the game one plays under the curtains, <label for=\"tufte-mn-2649\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; \" /><\/label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tufte-mn-2649\" class=\"margin-toggle\"><span class=\"marginnote\"><img src=\"materials/manicule.png\" style=\"height: 1.3em; vertical-align: bottom; display: inline-block; margin-left: -10%\" /> Although \"gordine\" (or \"cortine\") can refer to the \"couverture\" or the \"rideau qui entoure un lit\", I've decided to go with curtains for two reasons: 1.) to distinguish this word from the others the author uses to play with covering/uncovering literally and metaphorically and 2.) to call extra attention to the sexual innuendo here. The Godefroy dicitonary lists \"gordine\" as a \"femme galante, femme de mauvaise vie.\" Plus, the vulva is often described as having \"curtains.\"<\/span>","for I am a boy and in no way a girl.

<p>Translators are always making choices for their audiences. Normally, these choices are made invisible to facilitate a smoother reading experience, but this practice can give readers the false impression that what they are enjoying is an unmediated “true” expression of the original text. By allowing readers to make translation choices themselves, the complexity and playfulness of texts like <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> may be more fully appreciated.</p>
<p>On this page, you decide.</p>
