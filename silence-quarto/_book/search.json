    "section": "",
    "text": "Since at least its first edition produced by Lewis Thorpe in 1972, Le Roman de Silence has been the fuel for much impassioned debate concerning its mysterious author/narrator, Heldris of Cornwall, and his intended message regarding gender. Some labelling the text an outright misogynist defense of the status quo (Gaunt 1990) while others revel in the gendered possibilities the text allows its reader to imagine (Barr 2020). Despite a wide range of interpretations, the common thread running through all of this contentious scholarship is a shared frustration with the inability of modern language translations to convey the abundant polysemy of the text. The rich ambiguity of this thirteenth century Picard verse narrative has plagued translators for decades and has been the source of much scholarly disagreement as inadequate translations can only lead to inadequate analyses (Pratt 2003). However, it is not the fault of editors and translators but rather the limitations of traditional print technology that prevents us from properly engaging with this unique manuscript. Six years after producing her own translation of Silence in 1991, Regina Psaki expressed frustration with the way print editions — constructed by modern mediators — virtually set medieval texts in stone for modern readers thereby preventing fuller, more complex readings. Calling for a more “diplomatic” (81) approach, Psaki was skeptical of the role “electronic media” (83) might play in resolving the mediation problem, but she insisted that something be done to put this text — in its enigmatic entirety — in the hands of modern readers. Unlike a traditional print edition, a flexible, interactive digital edition could reflect the mutability of Heldris’s elusive language, thereby articulating the ways in which Silence itself translates gender (Campbell 2019).\nIn this book, I will build a prototype for such a digital edition.\n\n\nMany thanks to my dissertation committee for their ongoing encouragement and criticism, and I am forever indebted to my sister and in-home tech support Lindsay Lee."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here, you can compare the previous verse translations of this passage by Regina Psaki and Sarah Roche-Mahdi. Florence Bouchet has also produced a complete translation of Le Roman de Silence into Modern French (Bouchet 2000), but her translation has not been included here because it is written in prose.\nNotice the different translation choices that Psaki and Roche-Mahdi make. For example when Nature addresses Silence, the language of the text is ambiguous enough that each translator can choose different pronouns and gendered terms to refer to Silence (see especially vv. 2500-2501, 2539, & 2542-2546). Psaki elaborates on her and Roche-Mahdi’s translation styles in her article “Verse versus poetry: translating medieval narrative verse” (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine\nPsaki (1991)

    "text": "Here, you can compare the previous verse translations of this passage by Regina Psaki and Sarah Roche-Mahdi. Florence Bouchet has also produced a complete translation of Le Roman de Silence into Modern French (Bouchet 2000), but her translation has not been included here because it is written in prose.\nNotice the different translation choices that Psaki and Roche-Mahdi make. For example when Nature addresses Silence, the language of the text is ambiguous enough that each translator can choose different pronouns and gendered terms to refer to Silence (see especially vv. 2500-2501, 2539, & 2542-2546). Psaki elaborates on her and Roche-Mahdi’s translation styles in her article “Verse versus poetry: translating medieval narrative verse” (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Line \n    Psaki (1991) Translation \n    Roche-Mahdi (2007) Translation \n  \n \n\n  \n    2439 \n    When the child had learned enough \n    When the child was old enough \n  \n  \n     \n    to understand that he was a girl, \n    to understand he was a girl \n  \n  \n     \n    his father had a talk with him, \n    his father sat down to reason with him \n  \n  \n     \n    and told him the reason \n    and explain the circumstances \n  \n  \n     \n    they concealed and hid him. \n    which had led them to conceal his identity this way. \n  \n  \n    2444 \n    “If King Ebain knew what \n    “If, dear son, King Evan knew \n  \n  \n     \n    we have done with you, dear son, \n    what we are doing with you, \n  \n  \n     \n    your portion of what we have on earth \n    your share of our earthly possessions \n  \n  \n     \n    would be very small indeed; \n    would be very small indeed. \n  \n  \n     \n    for the king, fair son, has disinherited \n    For the king, dear son, disinherited \n  \n  \n    2449 \n    all the women in England, \n    all the women of England \n  \n  \n     \n    all because of a war \n    on account of the death of two counts \n  \n  \n     \n    between two counts who died \n    in battle they fought \n  \n  \n     \n    Because of two twins who lived then. \n    over twin heiresses they had married. \n  \n  \n     \n    Fair dear son, it is not for ourselves \n    Dear sweet precious son, we are not doing this \n  \n  \n    2454 \n    that we do this; it is for you. \n    for ourselves, but for you. \n  \n  \n     \n    You now know the entire reason, son. \n    Now, son, you know the whole situation. \n  \n  \n     \n    As you hold our honor dear, \n    As you cherish honor, \n  \n  \n     \n    conceal yourself from everyone.” \n    you will continue to conceal yourself from everyone.” \n  \n  \n     \n    And the child answered sweetly \n    And he replied very sweetly, \n  \n  \n    2459 \n    and quickly, like a good child: \n    briefly, as befits a well-bred child, \n  \n  \n     \n    “Do not fear anything at all, \n    “Don’t worry the least little bit. \n  \n  \n     \n    for if it please God I will indeed \n    So help me God, I will do it. \n  \n  \n     \n    conceal myself from everyone.” \n    I will conceal myself from everyone.” \n  \n  \n     \n    His father admonished him often, \n    The father gave him much good advice, \n  \n  \n    2464 \n    and so did his mother, \n    as did the mother often, \n  \n  \n     \n    the seneschal, and the nurse. \n    and the seneschal and the nurse; \n  \n  \n     \n    Everyone urged him to do right. \n    they all urged him to be good. \n  \n  \n     \n    He possessed such understanding \n    He was receptive to their teaching \n  \n  \n     \n    that he believed their instruction fully. \n    and heeded their admonitions well. \n  \n  \n    2469 \n    The seneschal, to improve the child \n    In order to build up his endurance \n  \n  \n     \n    and to teach him to ride, \n    and teach him to ride, the seneschal \n  \n  \n     \n    took him to the woods and streams, \n    took him through woods and streams, \n  \n  \n     \n    of which there were many in that country. \n    which were plentiful in the countryside. \n  \n  \n     \n    He took him most often out in the sun, \n    He took him out often in the scorching heat, \n  \n  \n    2474 \n    to make him look more like a boy. \n    in order to make a man of him. \n  \n  \n     \n    The child was so used to masculine ways, \n    He was so used to men’s usage \n  \n  \n     \n    and had so refused the feminine, \n    and had so rejected women’s ways \n  \n  \n     \n    that he very nearly was a boy; \n    that little was lacking for him to be a man. \n  \n  \n     \n    what could be seen of him was entirely male. \n    Whatever one could see was certainly male! \n  \n  \n    2479 \n    But he had other than masculine qualities in his makeup, \n    But there’s more to this than meets the eye — \n  \n  \n     \n    for he was, beneath his clothes, a girl. \n    the he’s a she beneath the clothes. \n  \n  \n     \n    In the early years the seneschal \n    The seneschal watched the child closely \n  \n  \n     \n    guarded him well, above all things. \n    during his early years, \n  \n  \n     \n    The more the child grew in size, \n    but the older he grew, \n  \n  \n    2484 \n    the more his abilities improved. \n    the easier that seneschal’s task became. \n  \n  \n     \n    When one cannot commit folly, \n    When one could find no folly in him, \n  \n  \n     \n    why should anyone restrain him? \n    what was the use of restraining him? \n  \n  \n     \n    The fact that he feared to lose his birthright \n    What they thought would cause him to be unsteady \n  \n  \n     \n    made him stick even closer to wisdom. \n    only caused him to adhere more closely to discretion. \n  \n  \n    2489 \n    His own heart taught him \n    His heart itself schooled him \n  \n  \n     \n    to avoid foolish behavior. \n    to eschew foolish behavior. \n  \n  \n     \n    Thus he had sufficient inclination, \n    Because of this, he was given a good deal of freedom. \n  \n  \n     \n    and by the time he was eleven, \n    And by the time was in his twelfth year, \n  \n  \n     \n    there was no one more adept than he: \n    none was his master any more. \n  \n  \n    2494 \n    when they played at jousting, \n    When they practiced wrestling, \n  \n  \n     \n    at tilting, or at swords, \n    jousting or skirmishing, \n  \n  \n     \n    he alone made all his peers tremble. \n    he alone made all his peers tremble. \n  \n  \n     \n    Silence improved at these immensely, \n    Silence was deeply disturbed about this, \n  \n  \n     \n    for his heart taught him \n    for her conscience told her \n  \n  \n    2499 \n    to do so for concealment’s sake. \n    that she was practicing deception by doing this. \n  \n  \n     \n    After twelve years, Nature came to him, \n    In her twelfth year, Nature appeared, \n  \n  \n     \n    talking with him and reproaching him sternly. \n    grumbling and complaining and blaming her. \n  \n  \n     \n    She told him, “Here is a strange thing, \n    She said to her, “This is a fine state of affairs, \n  \n  \n     \n    that you behave like a boy, \n    you conducting yourself like a man, \n  \n  \n    2504 \n    going out in the wind and the sun, \n    running about in the wind and scorching sun \n  \n  \n     \n    when I had a special mold from which \n    when I used a special mold for you, \n  \n  \n     \n    I formed you with my own two hands. \n    when I created you with my own hands, \n  \n  \n     \n    And the beauty I saved up for so long \n    when I heaped all the beauty I had stored up \n  \n  \n     \n    I concentrated all in you. \n    upon you alone! \n  \n  \n    2509 \n    A thousand people consider me stingy \n    There are a thousand people who think I’m stingy \n  \n  \n     \n    in beauty, of which you are full; \n    because of the beauty I stuffed you with, \n  \n  \n     \n    for I withheld beauty from a thousand others, \n    for I extracted the beauty of a thousand \n  \n  \n     \n    which I used to make you. \n    to create your lovely appearance! \n  \n  \n     \n    There are a thousand women in this life \n    And there are a thousand women in this world \n  \n  \n    2514 \n    who will greatly desire you \n    who are madly in love with you \n  \n  \n     \n    for the beauty they will see in you, \n    because of the beauty they see in you — \n  \n  \n     \n    and because they will think to find in you \n    you don’t suppose they think something’s there \n  \n  \n     \n    something that is not there at all. \n    that was never part of your equipment at all? \n  \n  \n     \n    And one woman may be your good friend now, \n    There are those who love you now \n  \n  \n    2519 \n    who would hate you with all her heart \n    who would hate you with all their hearts \n  \n  \n     \n    if she knew your real nature; \n    if they knew what you really are! \n  \n  \n     \n    for she would consider herself deceived \n    They would consider themselves misused, \n  \n  \n     \n    because her hope failed. \n    Having their hopes so cruelly dashed. \n  \n  \n     \n    Certainly you do me great wrong \n    It’s a very nasty thing you’re doing to me, \n  \n  \n    2524 \n    when you follow such an upbringing. \n    leading this sort of life. \n  \n  \n     \n    You must not travel the woods, \n    You have no business going off into the forest, \n  \n  \n     \n    throw, or shoot, or hunt. \n    jousting, hunting, shooting off arrows. \n  \n  \n     \n    Get away from here!” said Nature. \n    Desist from all of this!” said Nature. \n  \n  \n     \n    “Stay in the side-chambers, \n    “Go to a chamber and learn to sew! \n  \n  \n    2529 \n    for nature demands this! \n    That’s what Nature’s usage wants of you! \n  \n  \n     \n    You are not Silentius!” \n    You are not Silentius!” \n  \n  \n     \n    He answered, “I never heard such a thing! \n    and he replied, “I never hear that before! \n  \n  \n     \n    Silentius! Who am I then? \n    Not Silentius? Who am I then? \n  \n  \n     \n    My name is Silentius, I think, \n    Silentius is my name, I think, \n  \n  \n    2534 \n    or I am someone else than I was. \n    or I am other than who I was. \n  \n  \n     \n    But this I know well, by my right hand, \n    But this I know well, upon my oath, \n  \n  \n     \n    that I cannot be any other! \n    that I cannot be anybody else! \n  \n  \n     \n    So I am Silentius, \n    Therefore, I am Silentius, \n  \n  \n     \n    it seems to me, or I am no one.” \n    As I see it, or I am no one.” \n  \n  \n    2539 \n    He thought to himself \n    But then she convinced herself \n  \n  \n     \n    that Nature was speaking in sophistries; \n    that Nature’s spurious argument was plausible: \n  \n  \n     \n    because the -us was against natural law, \n    That because the -us was contrary to usage, \n  \n  \n     \n    his name was not Silentius. \n    her name was not Silentius. \n  \n  \n     \n    He wanted to stay in the chamber \n    She wanted to go and learn to sew, \n  \n  \n    2544 \n    as Nature had entreated him to, \n    just as Nature demanded of her; \n  \n  \n     \n    because neither for a fief nor an inheritance \n    she should not cultivate such savage ways \n  \n  \n     \n    should he keep up such a barbarous usage. \n    for fief or inheritance. \n  \n  \n     \n    At this point Nurture arrived, \n    But then Nurture arrived on the scene \n  \n  \n     \n    and saw Silence speaking to Nature. \n    and saw that he was talking to Nature \n  \n  \n    2549 \n    She asked him, “Whatever are you doing here?” \n    and said to him, “Hey! What are you doing here?” \n  \n  \n     \n    He answered, “Nature is quarreling with me. \n    He said, “Nature is scolding me, \n  \n  \n     \n    And in faith, it is not wrong \n    and she’s right, in fact, \n  \n  \n     \n    for her to show me and acquaint me with \n    to get me accustomed \n  \n  \n     \n    the usage that is lawful, \n    to appropriate habits, \n  \n  \n    2554 \n    for this one is not natural. \n    for this behavior is unnatural. \n  \n  \n     \n    Truly, no woman of my lineage \n    Truly, no woman of my lineage \n  \n  \n     \n    ever led such a life as this, \n    ever behaved in such a way, \n  \n  \n     \n    nor will I lead it any longer: \n    nor wil[l] I do so any longer! \n  \n  \n     \n    I will adopt the behavior of a woman. \n    I will keep to women’s ways. \n  \n  \n    2559 \n    I do not want to cut my hair short, \n    I won’t cut my hair short any more, \n  \n  \n     \n    disguise my clothing, wear breeches, \n    wear slit garments and breeches \n  \n  \n     \n    nor live like a boy any more, \n    And live like a boy \n  \n  \n     \n    hunting with bow and quiver. \n    with bow and quiver. \n  \n  \n     \n    It never happened to any woman, \n    Did anything like this ever happen to anyone? \n  \n  \n    2564 \n    ever!

Now, when I get dressed, \n  \n  \n     \n    to withdraw from some game \n    and don’t participate \n  \n  \n     \n    such as boys often play, \n    in the kinds of games that boys are used to, \n  \n  \n     \n    then all my companions say, \n    all my companions jeer, \n  \n  \n     \n    ‘This one will have a treacherous heart, \n    ‘This one will be a terrible coward, \n  \n  \n    2569 \n    if he lives long here and now.’ \n    if he lives that long!’ \n  \n  \n     \n    But they don’t know how it is with me. \n    But they don’t know how it is with me. \n  \n  \n     \n    If my garment opens by chance \n    Whenever I happen to get undressed, \n  \n  \n     \n    I’m afraid my sex will show. \n    I am afraid my sex will be discovered. \n  \n  \n     \n    I want to act differently now. \n    My idea of fun is very different. \n  \n  \n    2574 \n    I used to frequent the court; \n    I have been spending my time at court, \n  \n  \n     \n    but all this I have put behind me, \n    but I will put all this behind me \n  \n  \n     \n    and will live in peace. \n    and live very quietly from now on. \n  \n  \n     \n    The Almighty Who gave me life \n    The good Lord who created me \n  \n  \n     \n    can take care of me and feed me: \n    will be my shepherd and my guide. \n  \n  \n    2579 \n    for have I not heard it said \n    Haven’t I heard it said \n  \n  \n     \n    that He is of such great goodness \n    that in his great goodness \n  \n  \n     \n    that He gives to all His creatures \n    he dispenses of his bounty to each creature \n  \n  \n     \n    what their natures need? \n    according to its nature? \n  \n  \n     \n    Was ever a woman so tormented \n    Was any female ever so tormented \n  \n  \n    2584 \n    and deceived by base treachery? \n    or deceived by such vile fraud \n  \n  \n     \n    To act out of greed \n    as to do what I did out of greed? \n  \n  \n     \n    I cannot tolerate in any way.” \n    I certainly never heard of one!” \n  \n  \n     \n    When Nurture heard this, \n    When Nurture heard this, \n  \n  \n     \n    do you think she was happy about it? \n    do you think she was overjoyed? \n  \n  \n    2589 \n    Not at all! Indeed, she shuddered and raged. \n    Hardly! on the contrary, she quivered and scolded. \n  \n  \n     \n    She got angry with Nature \n    She was furious with Nature. \n  \n  \n     \n    and looked at her bitterly. \n    She looked her straight in the eye \n  \n  \n     \n    Then she told her very harshly, \n    and said most severely, \n  \n  \n     \n    “Curse you, Nature, \n    “Nature, leave my nursling alone, \n  \n  \n    2594 \n    leave my nursling alone. \n    or I will put a curse on you! \n  \n  \n     \n    I have completely denatured her. \n    I have completely dis-natured her. \n  \n  \n     \n    She will never succumb to you. \n    She will always resist you. \n  \n  \n     \n    If you do not leave off these visits \n    If you don’t stop haunting her, \n  \n  \n     \n    you will be able to boast only \n    you’ll have small reason for vanity left, \n  \n  \n    2599 \n    that through environment I can make \n    if I make a thousand people \n  \n  \n     \n    a thousand people work against nature. \n    work against their nature through nurture. \n  \n  \n     \n    All in all, I easily train \n    I have succeeded very well \n  \n  \n     \n    a noble child into a bad man. \n    in turning a noble child into a defective male. \n  \n  \n     \n    I will undo all your speech. \n    I will undo all your work. \n  \n  \n    2604 \n    Nature, begone, and take the child’s shame away with you.” \n    Nature, begone in disgrace!” \n  \n  \n     \n    When Nature had gone away, \n    When Nature had gone away \n  \n  \n     \n    descending the rock where \n    and descended from the rock \n  \n  \n     \n    Nurture had so argued, \n    where Nurture had attacked her so, \n  \n  \n     \n    behold the struggle begun again \n    the battle for Silence began again, \n  \n  \n    2609 \n    over Silence: for Reason \n    as you shall hear, for Reason \n  \n  \n     \n    showed her and told him why \n    stated her case, citing examples \n  \n  \n     \n    it would be very nearly death to him \n    as to why, if she abandoned her nurture \n  \n  \n     \n    to study and desire \n    to take up the habits of nature, \n  \n  \n     \n    to abandon his upbringing \n    it would be almost as bad \n  \n  \n    2614 \n    in order to do as Nature wished: \n    as killing herself. \n  \n  \n     \n    “Believe my advice, friend Silence, \n    “Believe what I say, friend Silence, \n  \n  \n     \n    and embrace abstinence. \n    and forbear! \n  \n  \n     \n    Make your heart a fortress. \n    Fortify your heart, \n  \n  \n     \n    If Nature, who torments you now, \n    for if Nature, who is now pressing you so hard, \n  \n  \n    2619 \n    takes you to her, in truth \n    takes it from you, believe me, \n  \n  \n     \n    You will never be a boy again. \n    you will never train for knighthood afterwards. \n  \n  \n     \n    You will lose both horse and cart. \n    You will lose your horse and chariot. \n  \n  \n     \n    Do not think that the king will give you \n    Do not think the king will go back on his word \n  \n  \n     \n    your fief for having lied, \n    and acknowledge you as rightful heir, \n  \n  \n    2624 \n    if he perceives your true nature.” \n    when he finds out your true nature.” \n  \n  \n     \n    Reason stayed with him \n    Reason stayed with him for so long \n  \n  \n     \n    And admonished him until \n    and admonished him so severely \n  \n  \n     \n    Silence understood clearly \n    that Silence understood very well \n  \n  \n     \n    that he had believed foolish advice \n    he had listened to bad advice \n  \n  \n    2629 \n    when he considered putting off \n    ever to think of doing away \n  \n  \n     \n    and denying his good old custom \n    with his good old ways \n  \n  \n     \n    to take up that of a woman. \n    to take up female habits. \n  \n  \n     \n    Then he began to remember \n    Then he began to consider \n  \n  \n     \n    the games people play in private, \n    the pastimes of a woman’s chamber — \n  \n  \n    2634 \n    which he had often heard described, \n    which he had often heard about — \n  \n  \n     \n    and he weighed in his heart \n    and weighed in his heart of hearts \n  \n  \n     \n    the woman’s role against his own, \n    all female customs against his current way of life, \n  \n  \n     \n    and saw that a man’s life is better \n    and saw, in short, that a man’s life \n  \n  \n     \n    than a woman’s, all things considered. \n    was much better than that of a woman. \n  \n  \n    2639 \n    “Truly,” he said, “in an evil hour \n    “Indeed,” he said, “it would be too bad \n  \n  \n     \n    will I go underneath, when I am on top. \n    to step down when I’m on top. \n  \n  \n     \n    I am on top now, and I would have to go beneath. \n    If I’m on top, why should I step down? \n  \n  \n     \n    Now I am most valorous and strong, \n    Now I am honored and valiant. \n  \n  \n     \n    but I wouldn’t be any longer; rather, in faith, \n    No I’m not, upon my word — I’m a disgrace \n  \n  \n    2644 \n    I’d be shamed if I wanted to be like the women. \n    if I want to be one of the women. \n  \n  \n     \n    I thought of it for my own pleasure. \n    I was trying to make life easy for myself, \n  \n  \n     \n    I have a mouth too hard for kissing, \n    but I have a mouth too hard for kisses, \n  \n  \n     \n    and arms too rough for embracing. \n    and arms too rough for embraces. \n  \n  \n     \n    I would quickly be beaten \n    One could easily make a fool of me \n  \n  \n    2649 \n    at the game people play under the covers, \n    in any game played under the covers, \n  \n  \n     \n    for I am a boy, and not a girl at all. \n    for I’m a young man, not a girl. \n  \n  \n     \n    I don’t want to lose my great honor, \n    I don’t want to lose my high position; \n  \n  \n     \n    nor exchange it for a lesser one. \n    I don’t want to exchange it for a lesser, \n  \n  \n     \n    I don’t want to give the lie to my father; \n    and I don’t want to prove my father a liar. \n  \n  \n    2654 \n    may God let me suffer death sooner. \n    I would rather have God strike me dead! \n  \n  \n     \n    No matter what Nature can do \n    Whatever Nature may do, \n  \n  \n     \n    I will not reveal my secret.” \n    I will never betray the secret!” \n  \n  \n     \n    This is the truth, according to the story \n    If what the story that keeps alive \n  \n  \n     \n    which preserves the memory of Silence, \n    the memory of Silence tell us \n  \n  \n    2659 \n    for never was there such self-control \n    is true, you never heard of such forbearance \n  \n  \n     \n    as you may hear about Silence. \n    as was to be found in Silence. \n  \n  \n     \n    I won’t say that he didn’t think \n    I’m not saying that he didn’t \n  \n  \n     \n    variously about his dilemma, that conflicting \n    go through periods of hesitation \n  \n  \n     \n    reflections didn’t war within him, \n    and inner conflict, \n  \n  \n    2664 \n    as one of such birth might have, \n    as might be expected in a young person who came of such good stock, \n  \n  \n     \n    or as someone who must observe \n    but who was also a tender child \n  \n  \n     \n    such a custom might incline to. \n    who had to force herself to live that way. \n  \n  \n     \n    The heart is a marvelous creature, \n    And the human heart is a creature \n  \n  \n     \n    with a very strange nature: \n    that has a strange and peculiar nature: \n  \n  \n    2669 \n    for it thinks very diversely, in truth, \n    it thinks a great deal, \n  \n  \n     \n    turning and returning often \n    turns the deep thoughts it harbors \n  \n  \n     \n    to the various thoughts it considers, \n    over and over again, far too often, \n  \n  \n     \n    because of which it often grieves. \n    and causes itself a great deal of grief. \n  \n  \n     \n    And so I say of Silence, \n    And that is why I say that Silence \n  \n  \n    2674 \n    whose restraint was so great, \n    showed such great forbearance, \n  \n  \n     \n    that his thoughts tormented him, \n    for his thoughts tormented him, \n  \n  \n     \n    and he felt it and suffered from it. \n    and he felt this and suffered from it. \n  \n  \n     \n    Every day he had to do the opposite \n    He was always ready to go against \n  \n  \n     \n    of what his heart wanted to do; \n    what his heart wanted him to do, \n  \n  \n    2679 \n    and he who works contrary \n    and whoever works against his will \n  \n  \n     \n    to his own will must often grieve. \n    finds himself often in a state of unhappiness. \n  \n  \n     \n    Silence’s heart was divided. \n    Silence’s heart was divided against itself. \n  \n  \n     \n    This was his twelfth winter: \n    It was the twelfth winter; \n  \n  \n     \n    the twelfth year had arrived \n    The twelfth year had begun \n  \n  \n    2684 \n    since he was first engendered. \n    since he first came into being. \n  \n  \n     \n    He was stern, and fair, and valiant, \n    The winter was cruel; he was lovely and noble, \n  \n  \n     \n    generous, courtly, loved by everyone. \n    generous, courteous, beloved by everyone. \n  \n  \n     \n    Two or three days he lived with his father, \n    He would spend two or three days with his father \n  \n  \n     \n    When he wished, and with his mother. \n    whenever he wishes, or with his mother."

    "text": "On this page, I offer my own traditional, static translation with notes. My translation attempts to account for the polysemous words in this passage of Silence. Where appropriate, I have taken etymologies into account. I welcome the reader’s contributions to improve this project.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Line \n    Roche-Mahdi (2007) OF Edition \n    My Translation \n  \n \n\n  \n    2439 \n    Quant l’enfes est de tel doctrine \n    When the child had such learning  Keeping \"learning\" here rather than emphasizing age is important because just before this passage Heldris describes the way the nurse and the seneschal educate Silence, and he repeats the word \"doctrine\" throughout that sequence. \n  \n  \n     \n    Qu’il entent bien qu’il est mescine, \n    that he well understood that he was a girl, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ses pere l’a mis a raison, \n    his father reasoned with him,  \"metre a raison\" is to have a talk with someone or to address someone, but I think it is important to emphasize the word \"reason\" here since the allegorical figure \"Reason\" will soon arrive to talk to Silence. \n  \n  \n     \n    Se li demostre l’oquoison \n    and showed him the cause \n  \n  \n     \n    Por que on le coile si et cuevre. \n    for which they cultivated and covered him so.  There is an apparent play on words here between the noun \"coil\" meaning \"testicule\" and the verb \"coillier\" meaning \"to collect/to harvest/to gather\". Here we see a connection between raising Silence as a boy and his family's ability to protect the inheritance of their lands. There is another apparent play on words between \"cuevre\" meaning \"a quiver\" and \"cuivriier\" (to torment), \"covrir\" (to cover). \n  \n  \n    2444 \n    “Se li rois Ebayns seüst l’uevre \n    “If the king Ebain knew the creation \n  \n  \n     \n    Que nos de vos, bials fils, menons, \n    that we are making of you, fair son, \n  \n  \n     \n    De quanque nos sos ciel avons \n    of all that we have under heaven \n  \n  \n     \n    Estroit li vostre pars petite; \n    your portion would be small;  \"Portion\" feels like the best word choice to me here because it recalls the Biblical theme of one's \"portion\" granted by God, which Silence will reference later in this passage. \n  \n  \n     \n    Car li rois, bials fils, desirite \n    for the king, fair son, disinherited \n  \n  \n    2449 \n    Toltes les femes d’Engletiere, \n    all the women of England, \n  \n  \n     \n    Tolt par l’oquoison d’une guerre \n    all because of a war \n  \n  \n     \n    De .ii. contes ki en moururent \n    between two counts who died in it \n  \n  \n     \n    Par .ii. jumieles ki dunt furent. \n    for two twins with whom they were bound. \n  \n  \n     \n    Bials dols ciers fils, n’est pas por nos \n    Fair sweet dear son, it is not for us \n  \n  \n    2454 \n    Cho que faisons, ainz est por vos. \n    that we do so, rather it is for you. \n  \n  \n     \n    Tolte l’oquoison, fils savés. \n    The whole cause, son, you know. \n  \n  \n     \n    Si chier come l’onor avés, \n    As dearly as you hold honor, \n  \n  \n     \n    Si vos covrés viers tolte gent.” \n    just so, you will cover yourself from everyone.”  \"Cover\" here has the message of shielding oneself from harm. In this way, honor is made out to be a sort of shield one wears for self-protection, and Silence must use both honor and clothing to conceal identity and remain safe from harm. The playing on cover/discover will be important later. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et cil respont moult dolcement, \n    And this [child] responded so sweetly, \n  \n  \n    2459 \n    Briément, al fuer de sage enfant: \n    briefly, with the disposition of a refined child:  \"Fuer\" having the dual meaning of \"price\"/\"rate\" or \"manner\"/fashion\" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. \"Disposition\" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like \"refined\" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is \"refined\" as in \"educated\" and \"refined\" as in \"processed\" goods. \n  \n  \n     \n    “Ne vos cremés, ne tant ne quant, \n    “Don’t sweat it one bit.  \"Cremer\" can mean \"bruler, embraser\" or \"craindre\", so I've gone a bit informal here with \"sweat it\" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly \"sweat\" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text. \n  \n  \n     \n    Car, se Deu plaist, bien le ferai, \n    For, so help me God, I’ll do it. \n  \n  \n     \n    Viers tolte gent me coverrai.” \n    I will cover myself from everyone.” \n  \n  \n     \n    Moult le castie biel li pere \n    The father often chastised him well,  This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in \"chastise\"/\"chasten\" or \"to make pure, chaste\". Silence will be able to live as a \"man\" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb \"castier\" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb \"chastrer\" meaning \"to castrate.\" \n  \n  \n    2464 \n    Et alsi fait sovent la mere, \n    And often so did the mother, \n  \n  \n     \n    Li senescals et la norice. \n    the seneschal, and the nurse. \n  \n  \n     \n    De faire bien cascun l’entice. \n    Each incited him to do well.  The etymology of this word \"entice\" includes a connotation of flames from the Latin \"titio\" for \"firebrand\", \"set on fire\", \"to fan the flames of\", \"to encourage.\" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat since Silence is changed with the exposure to the sun, but I've gone with \"incite\" because of its negative connotations. I see some humor in this verse as they are perhaps encouraging Silence to do the wrong thing but to do it well. \n  \n  \n     \n    Il est de tel entendement \n    He has such an intention  I feel like Silence's choice in all of this has been somewhat downplayed. Silence proves him/herself capable of making choices, and clearly so many people would not be trying to reason with him/her if it weren't for the fear that (s)he would disobey their wishes. \n  \n  \n     \n    Qu’il croit bien lor castiement. \n    that he had faith in their chastisement. \n  \n  \n    2469 \n    Li senescals por essaucier \n    The seneschal, to raise [him] in honor \n  \n  \n     \n    Et por apprendre a chevalcier \n    and to teach [him] to ride \n  \n  \n     \n    Le maine en bos et en rivieres \n    maneuvered him through woods and through streams  I chose this verb \"maneuvered\" to reflect how the original word \"maine\" has the word \"main\" as in \"hand\" in it and to reflect how the seneschal is physically reshaping Silence. Plus, the word \"maneuver\" has the connotation of a military exercise, which is kind of what Silence is being trained for as (s)he gains knightly skills. \n  \n  \n     \n    Ki sunt el païs bien plenieres. \n    which were rather plentiful in the land. \n  \n  \n     \n    Sel mainne plus sovent el halle \n    He maneuvered him so very often in the broiling sun \n  \n  \n    2474 \n    Par cho quel violt faire plus malle. / \n    so that such a beaten path might make [him] more male.  One could simply interpret this word \"violt\" as \"voloir\", but other obliquely related words come to mind as well. From \"voielete\" as in \"sentier\" in Modern French (\"path\" in English), and the word also brings to mind the verb \"vïoler\" meaning either \"to play the viol\" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or \"to dishonor\"/\"to take by force\"/\"to violate\". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated. \n  \n  \n     \n    Il a us d’ome tant usé \n    He was so used to men’s customs \n  \n  \n     \n    Et cel de feme refusé \n    and had refused those of women \n  \n  \n     \n    Que poi en falt que il n’est malles: \n    that little was lacking for him to be male: \n  \n  \n     \n    Quanque on en voit est trestolt malles. \n    All that one saw of him was quite male.  I like \"quite\" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of \"quite\" differently as meaning either \"very much\" or only \"somewhat\". \n  \n  \n    2479 \n    El a en tine que ferine: \n    But one cannot judge a book by its cover:  The original verse is an old idiom literally reading \"(S)he had in the bucket something other than flour.\" The ambiguity of \"El\" sounding like the pronoun \"Elle\" has been commented on by others. This idiom is playing on Silence being crafted by others, and the image of baking is especially relevant for the later appearance of Nature who is often described as forming beings through baking or forging. I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the English idiom I've provided here conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing. \n  \n  \n     \n    Il est desos les dras mescine. \n    Under the covers, he was a girl. \n  \n  \n     \n    Li senescals sor tolte rien \n    The seneschal, against all else \n  \n  \n     \n    Es premiers an le garda bien. \n    in the early years, kept watch over him. \n  \n  \n     \n    Com plus croist l’enfes en grandece, \n    As the child grew in stature,  My translation emphasizes Silence's growth in size as well as status. \n  \n  \n    2484 \n    Tant amenrist plus sa destrece. \n    so the more diminished his distress.  \"Destrece\" (and its English equivalent \"distress\") carries the connotations of both physical and financial hardship. As a legal term \"distress\" specifically refers to the seizure of property, which is the threat looming over Silence here. \n  \n  \n     \n    Quant on n’i puet folie ataindre \n    Since he couldn’t give rise to trouble there,  \"Ataindre\" can have the connotation of parentage, so I almost translated it to \"engender\", but that felt a bit too on the nose. \n  \n  \n     \n    Por quoi le devroit on destraindre? \n    why should anyone hold him back? \n  \n  \n     \n    Cho qu’il crient sa droiture perdre \n    Since they feared losing his rights, \n  \n  \n     \n    Le fait plus a savoir aherdre. \n    that fact taught him to adhere even more.  I see some irony in this verse as Silence's family is securing his \"rights\" while restricting his movements. \n  \n  \n    2489 \n    Ses cuers meïsmes bien l’escole \n    His own heart schooled him \n  \n  \n     \n    Al deguerpir maniere fole. \n    to renounce foolish manners.  I chose the verb \"renounce\" because of how it can be used to decline a role or position. Silence is forced to adopt one role while turning down another. \n  \n  \n     \n    Por cho a il lassor assés \n    Because of this, he had free rein.  I'm playing here with the earlier references to horseback riding. With the given \"lassor\" (also spelled \"laissor\" or \"loisir\"), I also see the Old French verb \"laissier,\" which can mean \"to let run on a slack lead.\" Silence may have a long leash, but (s)he is still bridled. I also like the English pun of \"rein\" and \"reign\" that ties in the issue of social class and inheritance. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et quant il ot .xi. ans passés \n    And when he had passed eleven years [of age], \n  \n  \n     \n    N’i a un seul de lui plus maistre. \n    there was not a one more masterly than he.  I think it's important to keep the word \"master\" here as Silence is being raised to be a young noble boy or \"master\" as (s)he masters these masculine skills. \n  \n  \n    2494 \n    Quant il joent a le palaistre, \n    When they played at wrestling, \n  \n  \n     \n    A bohorder, n’a l’escremir, \n    at jousting, or at fencing, \n  \n  \n     \n    Il seus fait tols ses pers fremir. \n    he alone made all of his peers quiver.  \"Quiver\" as in the noun appears several times in this narrative, and one might \"quiver\" with fear, pleasure, and anticipation. All of this physical contact with the other boys might have provoked the same effect Silence will later have on the King of France. \n  \n  \n     \n    [S]ilences forment s’enasprist, \n    They made Silence exasperated with himself \n  \n  \n     \n    Car ses corages li aprist \n    for his heart told him \n  \n  \n    2499 \n    Ke si fesist par couverture. \n    that what he was doing was a sham.  I like \"sham\" here because it conveys both a deception and a covering as in a pillow sham. Silence must remain undercover, and that deceit causes him/her to feel shame. \n  \n  \n     \n    Apriés .xii. ans si vint Nature \n    After twelve years, then came Nature \n  \n  \n     \n    Ki le blasme forment et coze. \n    who condemned and complained about their making of her. \n  \n  \n     \n    Dist li: “Chi a estrange coze, \n    She said to him: “What a strange case, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ki te deduis al fuer de malle, \n    that you play at being a male, \n  \n  \n    2504 \n    Et vas si al vent et al halle, \n    and go out in the wind and the broiling sun, \n  \n  \n     \n    Car une speciäl forme ai \n    when I had a special frame \n  \n  \n     \n    Dont a mes .ii. mains te formai. \n    with which I formed you with my [own] two hands. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et la bialtet qu’ai tant celé[e] \n    And the beauty that I had so sealed away  I am using \"seal\" in Nature's speech because it combines the actions of storing and concealing (as one might in a cellar) with the sealing of a legal agreement. Maintaining Silence's body as male is what seals the deal of her inheritance. This also supports Nature's use of the word \"scel\" in verse 2516. \n  \n  \n     \n    Ai tolte en toi amoncelee. \n    all of it I had accumulated in you. \n  \n  \n    2509 \n    .m. gens me tienent por escarse \n    A thousand people take me for a miser \n  \n  \n     \n    Por la bialté, dont tu iés farse; \n    for the beauty I stuffed you with;  \"Farse\" (or \"farce\") can refer to an absurdity, or in a culinary sense, it can also refer to stuffing. Here we can see a double meaning as Nature sees Silence making a mockery of her own substance so carefully prepared by Nature. \n  \n  \n     \n    Car jo ai de .m. gens retraite \n    for I retained from a thousand people \n  \n  \n     \n    La bialté, dont tu iés refaite. \n    the beauty with which you remain. \n  \n  \n     \n    .m. femes a en ceste vie \n    There are a thousand women in this life \n  \n  \n    2514 \n    Ki de toi ont moult grant envie \n    who covet you so greatly \n  \n  \n     \n    Por le bialté qu’eles i voient, \n    for the beauty that they see in you; \n  \n  \n     \n    Car puet scel estre eles i croient \n    for they believe there may be sealed there \n  \n  \n     \n    Tel cose qu’en toi nen a mie. \n    a certain something that you don’t have at all. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et tels est ore moult t’amie / \n    And some woman who might love you so much now \n  \n  \n    2519 \n    Qui te haroit de tolt le cuer, \n    who would harass you with all her heart, \n  \n  \n     \n    Se il de toi savoit le fuer, \n    if she knew about your lot...  My use of \"lot\" here is meant to convey the multiple meanings of \"fuer\", which can refer to the price or amount of something as well as to a person's disposition (in this passage alone see also verses 2459, 2503, 2561). \"Lot\" also conveys how Silence's identity as a man is meant to secure a plot of land. \n  \n  \n     \n    Qu’el s’en tenroit a malballie \n    for in this she would count herself maltreated for it;  Reading around this word \"malballie\" lends itself to some possibilities for sexual innuendo. For example in \"malbaillir\", we have the verb \"baillier\" meaning \"céder la jouissance ou l'exploitation d'un bien pour un prix et une durée fixés par contrat\", and from there we can see \"bailliee\" which refers to \"permission de prendre du bois\". \n  \n  \n     \n    Que s’esperance estroit fallie. \n    she and her aspirations would be crestfallen.  This hypothetical scenario set forward by Nature is almost certainly foreshadowing Eufeme's later attempts on Silence who will herself describe their encounter in economic terms (see verses 3884-8). \n  \n  \n     \n    Tu me fais, certes, grant laidure \n    You do me, to be sure, an ugly thing  The Matsumura dictionary also offers \"parties génitales\" as a possible use for the word \"laidure.\" It may be that Nature is specifically referring to the misuse of her handiwork in that department. \n  \n  \n    2524 \n    Quant tu maintiens tel noreture. \n    when you maintain such nurturing. \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne dois pas en bos converser, \n    You should not be out in the woods cavorting,  \"Converser\" can mean \"demeurer,\" \"fréquenter,\" \"avoir des rapports,\" or \"avoir des relations charnelles\". \n  \n  \n     \n    Lancier, ne traire, ne berser. \n    lancing, nor traipsing, nor shooting. \n  \n  \n     \n    Tol toi de chi!” cho dist Nature. \n    Get yourself out of here!” so said Nature. \n  \n  \n     \n    “Va en la cambre a la costure, \n    “Go sew in your chamber,”  We have again a possible double entendre as \"costure\" can refer to sewing or the cultivation of land (a common metaphor for reproduction). I invite the English reader to hear sew/sow in this verse. \n  \n  \n    2529 \n    Cho violt de nature li us. \n    This is Nature’s path, custom for him.  Here again we can see desired paths for Silence (see also verses 2474, 2543, and 2614 in this passage). I have pulled this verse out of Nature's speech and given it to the narrator because it feels more natural as an interjected observation coming from the narrator. \n  \n  \n     \n    Tu nen es pas Scilentius!” \n    “You are not Silentius!” \n  \n  \n     \n    Et cil respont: “Tel n’oï onques! \n    And this [child] responded: “I never heard such a thing! \n  \n  \n     \n    Silencius! qui sui jo donques? \n    Silentius! Who am I then? \n  \n  \n     \n    Silencius ai non, jo cui, \n    I have the name Silentius, I thought, \n  \n  \n    2534 \n    U jo sui altres que ne fui. \n    or I am somebody I wasn’t. \n  \n  \n     \n    Mais cho sai jo bien, par ma destre, \n    But well I know, by my right, \n  \n  \n     \n    Que jo ne puis pas altres estre! \n    that I can’t be anybody else! \n  \n  \n     \n    Donques sui jo Scilentius, \n    So I am Silentius, \n  \n  \n     \n    Cho m’est avis, u jo sui nus.” \n    it seems to me, or I am nobody.”  Many have called attention to this word \"nus\" as implying nudity as well as negation. I have rendered it as \"nobody\" to call attention to Silence's body, which will be made nude at the end of the narrative. \n  \n  \n    2539 \n    Dont se porpense en lui meïsme \n    Then he reflected on it himself \n  \n  \n     \n    Que Nature li fait sofime: \n    on the sophistry Nature made him: \n  \n  \n     \n    Por cho que l’-us est encontre us \n    That this -us was contrary to custom, \n  \n  \n     \n    N’a pas a non Scilentius. \n    that his name was not Silentius, \n  \n  \n     \n    Aler en violt a la costure \n    wanting him to go sew \n  \n  \n    2544 \n    Si com li a rové Nature, \n    just as Nature had raved at him, \n  \n  \n     \n    Car por fief, ne por iretage, \n    that for neither fief nor heritage, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne doit mener us si salvage. \n    he must not manifest a custom so savage.  Pushing against both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi, I do not think Silence has been convinced by Nature so quickly. In this section, I see Silence mulling over Nature's suggestions without fully accepting them, especially since Nature's discourse is referred to as \"sofime\" (v. 2540). \n  \n  \n     \n    Atant i sorvint Noreture \n    Suddenly there came Nurture \n  \n  \n     \n    Et voit que parole a Nature. \n    who saw that he was talking to Nature. \n  \n  \n    2549 \n    Di li: “Que fais tu, diva, chi?” \n    She said to him: “Say, what are you doing here?” \n  \n  \n     \n    Cil dist: “Nature tence a mi. \n    This [child] said, “Nature is contending with me. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et si n’est pas, par foi, a tort \n    And so it isn’t, by faith, wrong \n  \n  \n     \n    Qu’ele m’acostume et amort \n    that she accustom and mortify me \n  \n  \n     \n    A tel us ki est droitureus, \n    to such customs that are righteous, \n  \n  \n    2554 \n    Car cis us n’es pas natureus. \n    for this custom is not natural. \n  \n  \n     \n    Ainc feme, voir, de mon parage, \n    See here, never did a woman of my parentage \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne mena mais si fait usage, \n    ever manifest such a usage, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne jo plus longhes nel menrai: \n    nor will I manifest one any longer: \n  \n  \n     \n    A us de feme me tenrai. \n    I will handle myself as a woman customarily does. \n  \n  \n    2559 \n    Jo ne voel pas moi estalcier, \n    I do not want to cut my hair short, \n  \n  \n     \n    Fendre mes dras, braies calcier, \n    to rip my clothes, to burn my breeches, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne mais vivre a fuer de garçon, \n    or live in the manner of a boy,  I want to play with the homophones \"manner\" and \"manor\" here. \n  \n  \n     \n    Prendre mon coivre, et mon arçon. \n    with my quiver and my bow.  \"Arçon\" presents many possible interconnected meanings (certainly some sexual innuendos) including \"bow\" as in \"bow and arrow\" or for a musical instrument. \"Arçon\" can also refer to various arcs including the arc of a yoke or the arc of a saddle. And finally \"estre ou monter es arçons\" means to \"faire l'amour\", and \"perdre (les) arçons\" refers to falling from one's horse. \n  \n  \n     \n    Avint adonques mais a nule? \n    Well, has such a thing ever come to pass for anybody? \n  \n  \n    2564 \n    Nenil! adunc quant jo m’afule \n    Never! So, when I clothe myself, \n  \n  \n     \n    Por moi de tel giu a retraire \n    I will restrain myself from such games  Godefroy writes that the word \"giu\" (meaning \"jeu\") \"s'employait souvent pour désigner l'acte amoureux\". \n  \n  \n     \n    Com vallet suelent encor faire, / \n    as boys still play at thresholds.  The word \"suelent\" is giving me a lot of trouble. Thorpe, Psaki, and Rochd-Mahdi do not offer guidance on it. In Godefroy, I find the verb \"sueller\" as in \"mettre un seuil à, achever jusqu'au seuil.\" Are these amorous games played when young men cross thresholds? \n  \n  \n     \n    Dont dient tuit mi compagnon: \n    Then, all my companions will say: \n  \n  \n     \n    ‘Cis avra moult le cuer felon \n    “This one will have quite the underhanded heart \n  \n  \n    2569 \n    Se il vit longhes entressait.’ \n    if he lives that long.” \n  \n  \n     \n    Mais ne sevent com moi estait. \n    But they don’t know how it is with me. \n  \n  \n     \n    Se me desful par aventure \n    If I undress myself for example  The Matsumura dictionary includes \"par exemple\" as a possible interpretation of \"par aventure\". Here I do not see Silence being afraid of being seen nude exactly. Rather, I see Silence feeling anxiety about the fact that his/her \"nature\" changes simply by the act of undressing. \n  \n  \n     \n    Dont ai paor de ma nature. \n    I’m afraid of my nature. \n  \n  \n     \n    Conjoie moult diversement. \n    I experience pleasure so differently. \n  \n  \n    2574 \n    En cort aloie conversant, \n    At court, I used to go cavorting.  See verse 2525 for another use of \"converser.\" This connection would seem to compare the woods and the court as similarly wild spaces. \n  \n  \n     \n    Tolt cho metrai ariere dos \n    I will put all of this behind me, \n  \n  \n     \n    Et viverai dont a repos. \n    and so, I will live at ease. \n  \n  \n     \n    Cis Dameldex qui me fist naistre \n    The Lord who engendered me \n  \n  \n     \n    Me puet bien governer et paistre: \n    can govern and shepherd me well: \n  \n  \n    2579 \n    Queles! ja n’ai jo oï conté* \n    Doggone it! Haven’t I heard it recounted  My translation is a bit silly here, but \"queles\" or \"chaëles\" is an interjection of exasperation similar to \"For Heaven's sake!\" But also, \"chaële\" is the diminutive for a dog. Thorpe gives \"Que\" and says \"This line is hardly legible,\" so without access to the manuscript, I will take some liberties. \n  \n  \n     \n    Qu’il est plains de si grant bonté \n    that he is full of such great bounty \n  \n  \n     \n    Et done a tolte creäture \n    and gives to every creature \n  \n  \n     \n    Sofisalment lonc sa nature? \n    sufficiently according to his nature? \n  \n  \n     \n    Fu ainc mais feme si tanee \n    Was any woman ever so tanned  \"Tanee\" can mean both \"tanned\" and \"tormented\". I kept tanned because the text spends a lot of time describing the tanning of Silence's skin. Plus to \"tan someone's hide\" is to punish them similar to the way Silence is being physically corrected by his/her guardians, and \"tanning\" may be another reference to the craftwork performed on Silence's body by the hands of Nurture. \n  \n  \n    2584 \n    De vil barat, ne enganee \n    or engineered by such vile churning,  With \"engineered\" I'm connecting \"engan\", which only refers to \"tromperie\", with \"engin\" which can refer to \"tromperie\" as well as \"ingéniosité\". Silence has been fooled and engineered by disingenuous actors. For \"barat\" (meaning \"commerce,\" \"agitation/confusion,\" \"tromperie,\" or \"voleur\"), we also have the verb \"barater\" meaning \"battre le crème dans une baratte,\" and \"churning\" is a term that can be used to refer to a type of financial securities fraud. This may be a big stretch on my part, but it's fun to make words work overtime. \n  \n  \n     \n    Que cho fesist par convoitise? \n    that she might act out of covetousness? \n  \n  \n     \n    Nel puis savoir en nule guise.” \n    I cannot think of one in such a guise.”  The word \"guise\" can be easily translated to English as \"guise\", but in Old/Middle French with the alternative spellings \"guige\" or \"guiche\", this word can also refer to a \"courroie qui sert à porter l'écu, le cor, etc.\" or a \"bande servant de cache-sexe.\" In one word, we have connotations of heraldry, genitals, and dissimulation. \n  \n  \n     \n    Quant Noreture cho oï \n    When Nurture heard this, \n  \n  \n     \n    Cuidiés qu’ele s’en esjoï? \n    do you think that she rejoiced over it? \n  \n  \n    2589 \n    Nenil! anchois fremist et groce. \n    Not at all! in fact she quivered and grumbled \n  \n  \n     \n    Enviers Nature se coroce \n    She was caustic toward Nature,  With \"caustic\" I'm trying to pull in the double meaning of sarcastic/angry and corrosive, which is related etymologically with \"corrocier\". \n  \n  \n     \n    Et si l’esgarde surement. \n    and she glared at her so assuredly \n  \n  \n     \n    Puis li a dit moult durement: \n    Then she said to her so harshly: \n  \n  \n     \n    “Lassciés ester ma noreçon, \n    “Leave my nursling be, \n  \n  \n    2594 \n    Nature, a la maleÿçon. \n    Nature, a curse upon you! \n  \n  \n     \n    Jo l’ai tolte desnaturee. \n    I have totally denatured her.  It's interesting that Nurture refers to Silence in the feminine form considering Nurture is trying to reform Silence into a young man. Note the feminine ending used here for \"desnaturee\" and \"duree\" in the next verse. \n  \n  \n     \n    N’avra ja voir o vus duree. \n    Truly, she will endure you. \n  \n  \n     \n    Se ne lassciés icest anter \n    If you don’t leave off this haunting, \n  \n  \n     \n    Bien vos porés al loig vanter \n    you won’t be vaunting for long \n  \n  \n    2599 \n    Se jo ne fac par noreture \n    when I by means of nurture make \n  \n  \n     \n    .m. gens ovrer contre nature. \n    a thousand people work against nature. \n  \n  \n     \n    Jo noris tres bien, c’est la some, \n    I nourish very well; this is the sum \n  \n  \n     \n    D’un noble enfant un malvais home. \n    of a noble child made unwholesome man.  I've chosen \"unwholesome\" to communicate both physical and moral deficiency but also to convey Silence's incompleteness. \n  \n  \n     \n    Jo te desferai tolt ton conte. \n    I will undo all of your account.  We might see \"conte\" implying both a quantity and a narrative here. \n  \n  \n    2604 \n    Nature, envoies o ta honte.” \n    Nature, be on your way or shame on you.” \n  \n  \n     \n    Quant Nature s’en fu alee \n    When Nature had gone away \n  \n  \n     \n    Et o le roce a devalee \n    and had descended from the rock \n  \n  \n     \n    U Noreture ot si tencié, \n    where Nurture had so contended, \n  \n  \n     \n    Es vos l’estor recommencié \n    see how the restoration commenced  \"Estor\" can be a \"tournoi\" or a \"combat\" as previous translations interpret it, but \"estor\" is also \"équipement\" or \"provisions\" and is the etymological origin of the English word \"store.\" I see Nurture and Reason here taking back their project from Nature. \n  \n  \n    2609 \n    Seur Silence: car la Raisons \n    to reassure Silence: for Reason  By interpreting \"seur\" here as \"sure\" rather than \"over\" (as in \"sur\" in Modern French), Silence can be seen as a more active participant in this dialogue. This argument is about Silence, but importantly, it is Silence who must be convinced here. \n  \n  \n     \n    Li monstre, et dist les oquoisons \n    showed him and told him the causes  Silence's father gives only one \"oquoison\" (see verses 2442, 2450, & 2455): King Ebain's disinheritance of all English women, but Reason provides Silence with other more personal \"oquoisons\" including the benefits of leading a masculine identity. \n  \n  \n     \n    Que poi li valt mains de la mort \n    for which he would go nearly into the hands of death \n  \n  \n     \n    Se il s’acostume et amort \n    if he accustomed and mortified himself  See verse 2552 for a repeat of this phrasing. \n  \n  \n     \n    A deguerpir sa noreture \n    to renounce his nurture  See verse 2490 for a repeat of this verb. \n  \n  \n    2614 \n    Por faire cho que violt Nature. / \n    in order to do that which Nature desired. \n  \n  \n     \n    “Croi mon consel, amis Silence, \n    “Heed my counsel, friend Silence, \n  \n  \n     \n    Et aies en toi abstinence. \n    and abstain. \n  \n  \n     \n    Fai de ton cuer une ferté. \n    Make of your heart a fortress.  I would love to find a word that factored in the \"fierté\" meaning of \"ferté\" as well. \n  \n  \n     \n    S’a lui te prent, de la verté, \n    If she pressured you, in truth, \n  \n  \n    2619 \n    Nature, qui t’angoisce adés, \n    Nature, who is agonizing you plenty, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ja n’ieres mais vallés apriés. \n    Never again will you be a boy thereafter. \n  \n  \n     \n    Tolt perdrés cheval et carete. \n    You will lose horse and cart. \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne cuidiés pas li rois vos mete \n    Do not think that the king will deem you \n  \n  \n     \n    En l’onor, por estre parjure, \n    honorable for having perjured \n  \n  \n    2624 \n    S’il aperçoit vostre nature.” \n    if he were to perceive your nature.”  Both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi use the phrase \"true nature\" here, but that \"true\" is a modern insertion that I think goes too far to suggest that Silence's nature can be so easily determined. \n  \n  \n     \n    Raisons ja od li tant esté, \n    Reason stayed with him awhile \n  \n  \n     \n    Se li a tant admonesté \n    and had so admonished him \n  \n  \n     \n    Que Silences a bien veü \n    that Silence saw clearly \n  \n  \n     \n    Que fol consel avoir creü \n    that he had believed foolish counsel \n  \n  \n    2629 \n    Quant onques pensa desuser \n    when he ever thought to disuse \n  \n  \n     \n    Son bon viel us et refuser, \n    and to refuse his good old custom, \n  \n  \n     \n    Por us de feme maintenir. \n    in order to maintain the customs of women. \n  \n  \n     \n    Donques li prent a sovenir \n    Then that made him remember \n  \n  \n     \n    Des jus c’on siolt es cambres faire \n    the games people play alone in chambers  I wonder why the spelling of \"giu\" has changed here to \"jus\"? Compare with verses 2565 and 2649. Is this a play on the pronoun \"je\" which along with other variants can be spelled \"ju\" or \"jo\" as we see elsewhere in this passage? Is the author suggesting that these games are exercises that create gendered \"jus\"? \n  \n  \n    2634 \n    Dont a oï sovent retraire, \n    of which he had often heard recounted,  Note how the narrator also uses this verb \"retraire\" when discussing boys games earlier in this passage. See verse 2565. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et poise dont en son corage \n    and he weighed this in his heart \n  \n  \n     \n    Tolt l’us de feme a son usage, \n    all the customs of women against his usage, \n  \n  \n     \n    Et voit que miols valt li us d’ome \n    and he saw that the customs of men were worth more \n  \n  \n     \n    Que l’us de feme, c’est la some. \n    than the customs of women, that is the sum. \n  \n  \n    2639 \n    “Voire,” fait il, “a la male eure \n    “Look,” he said, “in a malign hour  With the exclamation \"voire\", Silence means to say \"truly\" or \"indeed\" (and not the command \"look\") as Psaki and Roche-Mahdi have respectively translated this verse, but in contemporary English, \"look\" is often used to draw attention to a point someone is trying to make. By translating this word as \"look\", we can see Silence as asserting his/her own point of view rather than being passively swayed by the admonishments of others. \n  \n  \n     \n    Irai desos, quant sui deseure. \n    will I bottom, when I’m a top.  I'm trying to use \"bottom\" and \"top\" here in the sense of queer slang to combine Silence's sexual/gender role with his position in the social hierarchy. I'm sure this double entendre has been clear to readers for a long time, but leaning into this lingo makes the verse smoother in translation I think. \n  \n  \n     \n    Deseure sui, s’irai desos? \n    I’m on top, am I going to bottom out? \n  \n  \n     \n    Or sui jo moult vallans et pros. \n    Now I am so valiant and proud. \n  \n  \n     \n    Nel sui, par foi, ains sui honis \n    No I’m not, in faith; rather I’m ashamed. \n  \n  \n    2644 \n    Quant as femes voel estre onis. \n    When I wanted to be one with the women, \n  \n  \n     \n    Gel pensai por moi aäsier. \n    in that way I thought to put myself at ease. \n  \n  \n     \n    Trop dure boche ai por baisier, \n    I have too hard a mouth for kissing, \n  \n  \n     \n    Et trop rois bras por acoler. \n    and too raw of arms for accolades.  There is a lot that can be done with this verse. First, the verb \"acoler\" can refer to any embrace about the neck, but here I find especially apt the use of \"acoler\" in the process of being knighted. I have tried to accommodate both amorous embraces and knighthood with \"accolades\", but I think more can be done there. Then, the adjective \"rois\" can mean \"dur\"/\"ferme,\" \"impétueux\"/\"violent,\" \"rudement,\" and I feel like there must be a pun here on \"king\" as well. I've gone with \"raw\" to refer to Silence's body as still being in development. I see Silence lamenting his/her liminal position as she is too hard for lovemaking and he is too fresh for knighthood. \n  \n  \n     \n    On me poroit tost afoler \n    One could totally make a fool of me \n  \n  \n    2649 \n    Al giu c’on fait desos gordine, \n    at the game one plays under the curtains,  Although \"gordine\" (or \"cortine\") can refer to the \"couverture\" or the \"rideau qui entoure un lit\", I've decided to go with curtains for two reasons: 1.) to distinguish this word from the others the author uses to play with covering/uncovering literally and metaphorically and 2.) to call extra attention to the sexual innuendo here. The Godefroy dicitonary lists \"gordine\" as a \"femme galante, femme de mauvaise vie.\" Plus, the vulva is often described as having \"curtains.\" \n  \n  \n     \n    Car vallés sui et nient mescine. \n    for I am a boy and in no way a girl. \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne voel perdre ma grant honor, \n    I don’t want to lose my high honor, \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne la voel tangier a menor. \n    nor do I want to touch a lesser,  I've gone with \"touch\" for \"tangier\" here. \"Tangier\" does not seem to appear in any of my reference texts, but I imagine it comes from the Latin \"tangere\" (\"to touch\") as \"tangible\" or \"tangent.\" \n  \n  \n     \n    Ne voel mon pere desmentir, \n    nor do I want to belie my father. \n  \n  \n    2654 \n    Ainz me doinst Dex la mort sentir. \n    So, I would rather God should strike me down; \n  \n  \n     \n    Por quanque puet faire Nature \n    for whatever Nature may do \n  \n  \n     \n    Ja n’en ferai descoverture.” \n    never will I uncover it.”  Both Psaki and Roche-Mahdi translate the \"en\" in this verse as \"my/the secret,\" but I prefer to keep the referent for \"en\" more ambiguous. \n  \n  \n     \n    Si est li voirs, cho dist l’estorie \n    If this is the truth, according to the story \n  \n  \n     \n    Ki de Silence fait memorie, \n    that commits Silence to memory \n  \n  \n    2659 \n    C’onques ne fu tels abstinence \n    there never was such abstinence \n  \n  \n     \n    Com poés oïr de Silence. \n    as you can hear about from Silence. \n  \n  \n     \n    Jo ne di pas qu’il ne pe[n]sast \n    I am not saying that he was not penanced \n  \n  \n     \n    Diversement, et ne tensast / \n    diversely, or that he did not tender \n  \n  \n     \n    Diverse cogitatiön \n    diverse cognitions  These verses from the narrator are a bit awkward, but some have commented on Heldris the author as often seeming deliberately verbose and grandiose perhaps to subdue his authority as narrator and add humor to the text. It is worth noting a potential play on words between \"cogitacïon\" meaning \"pensée\" and \"cognacïon\" meaning \"parentée.\" \n  \n  \n    2664 \n    Com enfant de tel natiön, \n    like a child of such breeding  I appreciate how \"breeding\" can accommodate both the act of reproduction and the good manners associated with the upper class. \"Natiön\" is working here in the same way. \n  \n  \n     \n    Meësmement enfant si tendre. \n    especially a child so tender \n  \n  \n     \n    Ki doit a tel usage entendre. \n    who had to render such usage. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et cuers s’est une creäture \n    And the heart is a creature \n  \n  \n     \n    Mervelles d’estrange nature: \n    of a marvelously strange nature: \n  \n  \n    2669 \n    Qu’il pense voir moult largement, \n    In truth, it thinks so abundantly, \n  \n  \n     \n    Torne et retourne trop sovent \n    It turns and returns too often \n  \n  \n     \n    Les larges pensers que requelt \n    the large thoughts it recollects \n  \n  \n     \n    Dont motes foie[e]s se duel[l]t. \n    for which it grieves most of the time. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et por cho di jo de Scilence \n    And for this, I say of Silence \n  \n  \n    2674 \n    Qu’i ert de moult grant abstinence, \n    that he had such great abstinence, \n  \n  \n     \n    Que ses pensers le tormentoit \n    that his thoughts tormented him, \n  \n  \n     \n    Et il le sentoit et sofroit. \n    and he felt them and suffered from them. \n  \n  \n     \n    Et tols jors ert pres a contraire \n    And every day he was ready to do contrary \n  \n  \n     \n    A cho que ses cuers voloit faire. \n    to that which his heart wanted to do. \n  \n  \n    2679 \n    Et qui ouevre contre voloir \n    And he who works against his will \n  \n  \n     \n    Soventes fois l’estuet doloir. \n    oftentimes suffers himself. \n  \n  \n     \n    Silences ot le cuer diviers. \n    Silence had a divergent heart. \n  \n  \n     \n    Cho fu li dozimes iviers, \n    This was his twelfth winter. \n  \n  \n     \n    Li ans dozimes est entrés, \n    The twelfth year had begun \n  \n  \n    2684 \n    Des qu’il fu primes engenrés. \n    since he was first engendered. \n  \n  \n     \n    Bien ert cruels, s’ert bials et pros, \n    It was certainly cruel; but he was fair and proud, \n  \n  \n     \n    Larges, courtois, amés de tols. \n    generous, courteous, loved by all. \n  \n  \n     \n    .ii. jors u .iii. mest o le pere, \n    Two days or three he would be with father, \n  \n  \n     \n    Quant il voloit, et o la mere. \n    when he wanted, or with mother."

By allowing readers to make translation choices themselves, the complexity and playfulness of texts like Le Roman de Silence may be more fully appreciated.\nOn this page, you decide."

    "text": "1.1 test section 1\nHere, you can compare the previous verse translations of this passage by Regina Psaki and Sarah Roche-Mahdi. Florence Bouchet has also produced a complete translation of Le Roman de Silence into Modern French (Bouchet 2000), but her translation has not been included here because it is written in prose.\nNotice the different translation choices that Psaki and Roche-Mahdi make. For example when Nature addresses Silence, the language of the text is ambiguous enough that each translator can choose different pronouns and gendered terms to refer to Silence (see especially vv. 2500-2501, 2539, & 2542-2546). Psaki elaborates on her and Roche-Mahdi’s translation styles in her article “Verse versus poetry: translating medieval narrative verse” (2007)."
