2439,Quant l’enfes est de tel doctrine,When the child had learned enough,When the child was old enough,,When the child had such learning,"Keeping ""learning"" here rather than emphasizing age is important because just before this passage Heldris describes the way the nurse and the seneschal educate Silence, and he repeats the word ""doctrine"" throughout that sequence.",When the child had been taught,
2440,"Qu’il entent bien qu’il est mescine,","to understand that he was a girl,",to understand he was a girl,,"that he well understood that he was a girl,",,"and knew that a boy he was not,",
2441,"Ses pere l’a mis a raison,","his father had a talk with him,",his father sat down to reason with him,,"his father reasoned with him,","""metre a raison"" is to have a talk with someone or to address someone, but I think it is important to emphasize the word ""reason"" here since the allegorical figure ""Reason"" will soon arrive to talk to Silence.",his father set him to reason,
2442,Se li demostre l’oquoison,and told him the reason,and explain the circumstances,,and showed him the cause,,and told him of the occasion,
2443,Por que on le coile si et cuevre.,they concealed and hid him.,which had led them to conceal his identity this way.,,for which they cultivated and covered him so.,"There is an apparent play on words here between the noun ""coil"" meaning ""testicule"" and the verb ""coillier"" meaning ""to collect/to harvest/to gather"". Here we see a connection between raising Silence as a boy and his family's ability to protect the inheritance of their lands. There is another apparent play on words between ""cuevre"" meaning ""a quiver"" and ""cuivriier"" (to torment), ""covrir"" (to cover).",for which they had him so raised and hidden.,
2444,“Se li rois Ebayns seüst l’uevre,“If King Ebain knew what,"“If, dear son, King Evan knew",,“If the king Ebain knew the creation,,"""If the king Ebain knew our biddin'",
2445,"Que nos de vos, bials fils, menons,","we have done with you, dear son,","what we are doing with you,","that we of you, fair son, are making","that we are making of you, fair son,",,"that we are making of you a fair son,",
2446,De quanque nos sos ciel avons,your portion of what we have on earth,your share of our earthly possessions,of all that we under heaven have,of all that we have under heaven,,of all that we have under heaven,
2447,Estroit li vostre pars petite;,would be very small indeed;,would be very small indeed.,,your portion would be small;,"""Portion"" feels like the best word choice to me here because it recalls the Biblical theme of one's ""portion"" granted by God, which Silence will reference later in this passage.",your portion would be struck off,
2448,"Car li rois, bials fils, desirite","for the king, fair son, has disinherited","For the king, dear son, disinherited",,"for the king, fair son, disinherited",,"for the king, dear son, cut off",
2449,"Toltes les femes d’Engletiere,","all the women in England,",all the women of England,,"all the women of England,",,all the English women,
2450,Tolt par l’oquoison d’une guerre,all because of a war,on account of the death of two counts,,all because of a war,,all because of a war that was driven,
2451,De .ii. contes ki en moururent,between two counts who died,in battle they fought,,between two counts who died in it,,by two counts who in it died,
2452,Par .ii. jumieles ki dunt furent.,Because of two twins who lived then.,over twin heiresses they had married.,,for two twins with whom they were bound.,,for two twins with whom they were tied.,
2453,"Bials dols ciers fils, n’est pas por nos","Fair dear son, it is not for ourselves","Dear sweet precious son, we are not doing this",,"Fair sweet dear son, it is not for us",,"Fair sweet dear son, it is not for us",
2454,"Cho que faisons, ainz est por vos.",that we do this; it is for you.,"for ourselves, but for you.",,"that we do so, rather it is for you.",,rather it is for you that we do thus.,
2455,"Tolte l’oquoison, fils savés.","You now know the entire reason, son.","Now, son, you know the whole situation.",,"The whole cause, son, you know.",,"The whole occasion, son, you know.",
2456,"Si chier come l’onor avés,","As you hold our honor dear,","As you cherish honor,",,"As dearly as you hold honor,",,"As dearly as the honor you show,",
2457,Si vos covrés viers tolte gent.”,conceal yourself from everyone.”,you will continue to conceal yourself from everyone.”,,"just so, you will cover yourself from everyone.”","""Cover"" here has the message of shielding oneself from harm. In this way, honor is made out to be a sort of shield one wears for self-protection, and Silence must use both honor and clothing to conceal identity and remain safe from harm. The playing on cover/discover will be important later.","cover yourself from everyone.""",
2458,"Et cil respont moult dolcement,",And the child answered sweetly,"And he replied very sweetly,","And this one responded so sweetly,","And this [child] responded so sweetly,",,"So sweetly responded this one,",
2459,"Briément, al fuer de sage enfant:","and quickly, like a good child:","briefly, as befits a well-bred child,",,"briefly, with the disposition of a refined child:","""Fuer"" having the dual meaning of ""price""/""rate"" or ""manner""/fashion"" depending on context. Again we have a polysemous word connecting the ideas of behavior, character, and inheritance. ""Disposition"" is meant to reflect Silence's behavior and the legal situation he finds himself in concerning the transfer of property rights. I also like ""refined"" here because it refers to how Silence has been fashioned by his environment both physically and mentally. Silence is ""refined"" as in ""educated"" and ""refined"" as in ""processed"" goods.","briefly, with the disposition of a refined young'un:",
2460,"“Ne vos cremés, ne tant ne quant,","“Do not fear anything at all,",“Don’t worry the least little bit.,,“Don’t sweat it one bit.,"""Cremer"" can mean ""bruler, embraser"" or ""craindre"", so I've gone a bit informal here with ""sweat it"" to reflect the dual idea of worry and heat and to show Silence's youth. More abstractly ""sweat"" is also used in cooking and welding, which plays with the trades Nature engages with in the text.","""Don't sweat it none.",
2461,"Car, se Deu plaist, bien le ferai,",for if it please God I will indeed,"So help me God, I will do it.",,"For, so help me God, I’ll do it.",,"For, I'll do it if it pleases God.",
2462,Viers tolte gent me coverrai.”,conceal myself from everyone.”,I will conceal myself from everyone.”,"From everyone, I will cover myself.""",I will cover myself from everyone.”,,"From everyone I'll cover up my bod.""",
2463,Moult le castie biel li pere,"His father admonished him often,","The father gave him much good advice,","Often, he chastised him well the father","The father often chastised him well,","This choice of words is interesting because it combines the notion of reprimanding and purifying at the same time, as in ""chastise""/""chasten"" or ""to make pure, chaste"". Silence will be able to live as a ""man"" provided that (s)he is chaste as this is the only activity as a man that she cannot perform. This verb ""castier"" also obliquely brings to mind the similar verb ""chastrer"" meaning ""to castrate.""",Often chastising him was the father,
2464,"Et alsi fait sovent la mere,","and so did his mother,","as did the mother often,","And so did often the mother,","And often so did the mother,",,"And as often was the mother,",
2465,Li senescals et la norice.,"the seneschal, and the nurse.",and the seneschal and the nurse;,,"the seneschal, and the nurse.",,"the seneschal, and the nurse.",
2466,De faire bien cascun l’entice.,Everyone urged him to do right.,they all urged him to be good.,To do well each incited him.,Each incited him to do well.,"The etymology of this word ""entice"" includes a connotation of flames from the Latin ""titio"" for ""firebrand"", ""set on fire"", ""to fan the flames of"", ""to encourage."" I'd love a word that includes the connotation of heat since Silence is changed with the exposure to the sun, but I've gone with ""incite"" because of its negative connotations. I see some humor in this verse as they are perhaps encouraging Silence to do the wrong thing but to do it well.","For him to do well, each did coerce.",
2467,Il est de tel entendement,He possessed such understanding,He was receptive to their teaching,,He has such an intention,"I feel like Silence's choice in all of this has been somewhat downplayed. Silence proves him/herself capable of making choices, and clearly so many people would not be trying to reason with him/her if it weren't for the fear that (s)he would disobey their wishes.",He fully intended,
2468,Qu’il croit bien lor castiement.,that he believed their instruction fully.,and heeded their admonitions well.,,that he had faith in their chastisement.,,to believe what they recommended,
2469,Li senescals por essaucier,"The seneschal, to improve the child",In order to build up his endurance,,"The seneschal, to raise [him] in honor",,"To raise [him] in honor, the seneschal",
2470,Et por apprendre a chevalcier,"and to teach him to ride,","and teach him to ride, the seneschal",,and to teach [him] to ride,,taught [him] to ride à cheval,
2471,Le maine en bos et en rivieres,"took him to the woods and streams,","took him through woods and streams,",,maneuvered him through woods and through streams,"I chose this verb ""maneuvered"" to reflect how the original word ""maine"" has the word ""main"" as in ""hand"" in it and to reflect how the seneschal is physically reshaping Silence. Plus, the word ""maneuver"" has the connotation of a military exercise, which is kind of what Silence is being trained for as (s)he gains knightly skills.",He maneuvered him through the woods and streams,
2472,Ki sunt el païs bien plenieres.,of which there were many in that country.,which were plentiful in the countryside.,which were in the land rather plentiful.,which were rather plentiful in the land.,,with which this land really teems.,
2473,Sel mainne plus sovent el halle,"He took him most often out in the sun,","He took him out often in the scorching heat,",,He maneuvered him so very often in the broiling sun,,He maneuvered him so very often in the heat,
2474,Par cho quel violt faire plus malle. /,to make him look more like a boy.,in order to make a man of him.,,so that such a beaten path might make [him] more male.,"One could simply interpret this word ""violt"" as ""voloir"", but other obliquely related words come to mind as well. From ""voielete"" as in ""sentier"" in Modern French (""path"" in English), and the word also brings to mind the verb ""vïoler"" meaning either ""to play the viol"" (as Silence will later do during his career as a jongleur) or ""to dishonor""/""to take by force""/""to violate"". Here we can see how this word, especially when heard aloud, can bring up many ideas at once. I want to convey that this is a difficult path both literally and metaphorically that Silence is being forced onto. They are riding horses too, so bridlepath could work, but beaten path shows how this is a new, unfamiliar trail. Either option expresses how Silence is being physically manipulated.",so that his desire to make him more male might be complete.,
2475,Il a us d’ome tant usé,"The child was so used to masculine ways,",He was so used to men’s usage,He was to men's customs so used,He was so used to men’s customs,,"To men's customs he was so used,",
2476,Et cel de feme refusé,"and had so refused the feminine,",and had so rejected women’s ways,and those of women [so] refused,and had refused those of women,,and those of women he had refused,
2477,Que poi en falt que il n’est malles:,that he very nearly was a boy;,that little was lacking for him to be a man.,,that little was lacking for him to be male:,,that little was lacking for him to be male:,
2478,Quanque on en voit est trestolt malles.,what could be seen of him was entirely male.,Whatever one could see was certainly male!,,All that one saw of him was quite male.,"I like ""quite"" here because it lends itself to some ambiguity as different English speakers around the world perceive of ""quite"" differently as meaning either ""very much"" or only ""somewhat"".",All that one saw of him was quite male.,
2479,El a en tine que ferine:,"But he had other than masculine qualities in his makeup,",But there’s more to this than meets the eye —,[But] (S)he had in the bucket something other than flour:,But one cannot judge a book by its cover:,"The original verse is an old idiom literally reading ""(S)he had in the bucket something other than flour."" The ambiguity of ""El"" sounding like the pronoun ""Elle"" has been commented on by others. This idiom is playing on Silence being crafted by others, and the image of baking is especially relevant for the later appearance of Nature who is often described as forming beings through baking or forging. I really want there to be a more direct English idiom for this, but at least the English idiom I've provided here conveys both the motif of coverings and the motif of inscribing.",[But] (S)he had in the bucket something other than flour:,
2480,Il est desos les dras mescine.,"for he was, beneath his clothes, a girl.",the he’s a she beneath the clothes.,"He was, under the covers, a girl.","Under the covers, he was a girl.",,"Under the covers, a girl did cower.",The more literal meaning of this verse has been stretched to accomodate the rhyme.
2481,Li senescals sor tolte rien,In the early years the seneschal,The seneschal watched the child closely,,"The seneschal, against all else",,"The seneschal, against any tell",
2482,Es premiers an le garda bien.,"guarded him well, above all things.","during his early years,",,"in the early years, kept watch over him.",,"in the early years, guarded him well.",
2483,"Com plus croist l’enfes en grandece,","The more the child grew in size,","but the older he grew,",,"As the child grew in stature,",My translation emphasizes Silence's growth in size as well as status.,As the child grew in noblesse,
2484,Tant amenrist plus sa destrece.,the more his abilities improved.,the easier that seneschal’s task became.,,so the more diminished his distress.,"""Destrece"" (and its English equivalent ""distress"") carries the connotations of both physical and financial hardship. As a legal term ""distress"" specifically refers to the seizure of property, which is the threat looming over Silence here.",so the more diminished his distress.,
2485,Quant on n’i puet folie ataindre,"When one cannot commit folly,","When one could find no folly in him,","Since there he couldn't give rise to trouble,","Since he couldn’t give rise to trouble there,","""Ataindre"" can have the connotation of parentage, so I almost translated it to ""engender"", but that felt a bit too on the nose.","Since he couldn't give rise there to trouble,",
2486,Por quoi le devroit on destraindre?,why should anyone restrain him?,what was the use of restraining him?,,why should anyone hold him back?,,why should anyone keep him in a bubble?,
2487,Cho qu’il crient sa droiture perdre,The fact that he feared to lose his birthright,What they thought would cause him to be unsteady,,"Since they feared losing his rights,",,"Of losing his rights, they were afeared,",
2488,Le fait plus a savoir aherdre.,made him stick even closer to wisdom.,only caused him to adhere more closely to discretion.,that fact even more taught him to adhere,that fact taught him to adhere even more.,"I see some irony in this verse as Silence's family is securing his ""rights"" while restricting his movements.","and so, even more he adhered.",
2489,Ses cuers meïsmes bien l’escole,His own heart taught him,His heart itself schooled him,,His own heart schooled him,,His own heart was his school,
2490,Al deguerpir maniere fole.,to avoid foolish behavior.,to eschew foolish behavior.,,to renounce foolish manners.,"I chose the verb ""renounce"" because of how it can be used to decline a role or position. Silence is forced to adopt one role while turning down another.",for renouncing the manners of a fool.,
2491,Por cho a il lassor assés,"Thus he had sufficient inclination,","Because of this, he was given a good deal of freedom.",,"Because of this, he had free rein.","I'm playing here with the earlier references to horseback riding. With the given ""lassor"" (also spelled ""laissor"" or ""loisir""), I also see the Old French verb ""laissier,"" which can mean ""to let run on a slack lead."" Silence may have a long leash, but (s)he is still bridled. I also like the English pun of ""rein"" and ""reign"" that ties in the issue of social class and inheritance.","Because of this, his slack was vast.",
2492,Et quant il ot .xi. ans passés,"and by the time he was eleven,","And by the time was in his twelfth year,","And when he had eleven years passed,","And when he had passed eleven years [of age],",,"And when he had eleven years passed,",
2493,N’i a un seul de lui plus maistre.,there was no one more adept than he:,none was his master any more.,,there was not a one more masterly than he.,"I think it's important to keep the word ""master"" here as Silence is being raised to be a young noble boy or ""master"" as (s)he masters these masculine skills.",None was more the master,"To make the rhyme of this couplet work, you've got to drop the hard ""r"" in ""master""."
2494,"Quant il joent a le palaistre,","when they played at jousting,","When they practiced wrestling,",,"When they played at wrestling,",,"When they played at the palaestra,","A ""palaestra"" was a space used for athletics, especially wrestling, in ancient Rome and Greece."
2495,"A bohorder, n’a l’escremir,","at tilting, or at swords,","jousting or skirmishing,",,"at jousting, or at fencing,",,"at jousting, or at the foil,",
2496,Il seus fait tols ses pers fremir.,he alone made all his peers tremble.,he alone made all his peers tremble.,,he alone made all of his peers quiver.,"""Quiver"" as in the noun appears several times in this narrative, and one might ""quiver"" with fear, pleasure, and anticipation. All of this physical contact with the other boys might have provoked the same effect Silence will later have on the King of France.",he alone made all his peers boil.,
2497,"[S]ilences forment s’enasprist,","Silence improved at these immensely,","Silence was deeply disturbed about this,",,They made Silence exasperated with himself,,They got under Silence's skin,
2498,Car ses corages li aprist,for his heart taught him,for her conscience told her,,for his heart told him,,for his heart therein,
2499,Ke si fesist par couverture.,to do so for concealment’s sake.,that she was practicing deception by doing this.,,that what he was doing was a sham.,"I like ""sham"" here because it conveys both a deception and a covering as in a pillow sham. Silence must remain undercover, and that deceit causes him/her to feel shame.",said what he did was a shame.,
2500,Apriés .xii. ans si vint Nature,"After twelve years, Nature came to him,","In her twelfth year, Nature appeared,",,"After twelve years, then came Nature",,"After twelve years, then Nature came",
2501,Ki le blasme forment et coze.,talking with him and reproaching him sternly.,grumbling and complaining and blaming her.,,who condemned and complained about their making of her.,,who condemned and complained their making her this way.,
2502,"Dist li: “Chi a estrange coze,","She told him, “Here is a strange thing,","She said to her, “This is a fine state of affairs,",,"She said to him: “What a strange case,",,"She said to him: ""How strange, pray,",
2503,"Ki te deduis al fuer de malle,","that you behave like a boy,","you conducting yourself like a man,",,"that you play at being a male,",,"that you play at being a male,",
2504,"Et vas si al vent et al halle,","going out in the wind and the sun,",running about in the wind and scorching sun,,"and go out in the wind and the broiling sun,",,"and go out in the wind and the hail,","""Halle"" is really refering to the heat of the sun, but ""hail"" has been substituted here for the sake of the rhyme."
2505,Car une speciäl forme ai,when I had a special mold from which,"when I used a special mold for you,",,when I had a special frame,,when I had a special mold,
2506,Dont a mes .ii. mains te formai.,I formed you with my own two hands.,"when I created you with my own hands,",which with my own two hands I formed you.,with which I formed you with my [own] two hands.,,with which my own two hands you I did mold.,
2507,Et la bialtet qu’ai tant celé[e],And the beauty I saved up for so long,when I heaped all the beauty I had stored up,,And the beauty that I had so sealed away,"I am using ""seal"" in Nature's speech because it combines the actions of storing and concealing (as one might in a cellar) with the sealing of a legal agreement. Maintaining Silence's body as male is what seals the deal of her inheritance. This also supports Nature's use of the word ""scel"" in verse 2516.",And the beauty I had so concealed,
2508,Ai tolte en toi amoncelee.,I concentrated all in you.,upon you alone!,all of it in you I had accumulated.,all of it I had accumulated in you.,,all of it in you I had it sealed,
2509,.m. gens me tienent por escarse,A thousand people consider me stingy,There are a thousand people who think I’m stingy,,A thousand people take me for a miser,,A thousand people take me for a miser,
2510,"Por la bialté, dont tu iés farse;","in beauty, of which you are full;","because of the beauty I stuffed you with,",,for the beauty I stuffed you with;,"""Farse"" (or ""farce"") can refer to an absurdity, or in a culinary sense, it can also refer to stuffing. Here we can see a double meaning as Nature sees Silence making a mockery of her own substance so carefully prepared by Nature.",for the beauty I stuffed inside her;,"This verse should be directed at Silence in the second-person, but I've made it third person for the rhyme."
2511,Car jo ai de .m. gens retraite,"for I withheld beauty from a thousand others,",for I extracted the beauty of a thousand,,for I retained from a thousand people,,for from a thousand people I retained,
2512,"La bialté, dont tu iés refaite.",which I used to make you.,to create your lovely appearance!,,the beauty with which you remain.,,the beauty with which you have remained.,
2513,.m. femes a en ceste vie,There are a thousand women in this life,And there are a thousand women in this world,A thousand women there are in this life,There are a thousand women in this life,,There are a thousand women in this life,
2514,Ki de toi ont moult grant envie,who will greatly desire you,who are madly in love with you,,who covet you so greatly,,who for you are so full of strife,
2515,"Por le bialté qu’eles i voient,","for the beauty they will see in you,",because of the beauty they see in you —,,for the beauty that they see in you;,,for the beauty in you they see;,
2516,Car puet scel estre eles i croient,and because they will think to find in you,you don’t suppose they think something’s there,for maybe sealed there is — they believe —,for they believe there may be sealed there,,for they believe sealed there may be,
2517,Tel cose qu’en toi nen a mie.,something that is not there at all.,that was never part of your equipment at all?,,a certain something that you don’t have at all.,,a certain something that you don't have anyhow.,
2518,Et tels est ore moult t’amie /,"And one woman may be your good friend now,",There are those who love you now,,And some woman who might love you so much now,,And some woman who might love you so much now,
2519,"Qui te haroit de tolt le cuer,",who would hate you with all her heart,who would hate you with all their hearts,,"who would harass you with all her heart,",,"who would harass you with all her heart,",
2520,"Se il de toi savoit le fuer,",if she knew your real nature;,if they knew what you really are!,,if she knew about your lot...,"My use of ""lot"" here is meant to convey the multiple meanings of ""fuer"", which can refer to the price or amount of something as well as to a person's disposition (in this passage alone see also verses 2459, 2503, 2561). ""Lot"" also conveys how Silence's identity as a man is meant to secure a plot of land.",if she knew about your part...,
2521,Qu’el s’en tenroit a malballie,for she would consider herself deceived,"They would consider themselves misused,",,for in this she would count herself maltreated for it;,"Reading around this word ""malballie"" lends itself to some possibilities for sexual innuendo. For example in ""malbaillir"", we have the verb ""baillier"" meaning ""céder la jouissance ou l'exploitation d'un bien pour un prix et une durée fixés par contrat"", and from there we can see ""bailliee"" which refers to ""permission de prendre du bois"".",for in this she would count herself maltreated;,
2522,Que s’esperance estroit fallie.,because her hope failed.,Having their hopes so cruelly dashed.,,she and her aspirations would be crestfallen.,This hypothetical scenario set forward by Nature is almost certainly foreshadowing Eufeme's later attempts on Silence who will herself describe their encounter in economic terms (see verses 3884-8).,she and her aspirations would be defeated.,
2523,"Tu me fais, certes, grant laidure",Certainly you do me great wrong,"It’s a very nasty thing you’re doing to me,",,"You do me, to be sure, an ugly thing","The Matsumura dictionary also offers ""parties génitales"" as a possible use for the word ""laidure."" It may be that Nature is specifically referring to the misuse of her handiwork in that department.","You do me, to be sure, an ugly thing",
2524,Quant tu maintiens tel noreture.,when you follow such an upbringing.,leading this sort of life.,,when you maintain such nurturing.,,when you maintain such nurturing.,
2525,"Ne dois pas en bos converser,","You must not travel the woods,","You have no business going off into the forest,",,"You should not be out in the woods cavorting,","""Converser"" can mean ""demeurer,"" ""fréquenter,"" ""avoir des rapports,"" or ""avoir des relations charnelles"".","You should not be out in the woods hooting,",
2526,"Lancier, ne traire, ne berser.","throw, or shoot, or hunt.","jousting, hunting, shooting off arrows.",,"lancing, nor traipsing, nor shooting.",,"lancing, nor traipsing, nor shooting.",
2527,Tol toi de chi!” cho dist Nature.,Get away from here!” said Nature.,Desist from all of this!” said Nature.,,Get yourself out of here!” so said Nature.,,"Get yourself out of here!"" Naure said so.",
2528,"“Va en la cambre a la costure,","“Stay in the side-chambers,",“Go to a chamber and learn to sew!,,"“Go sew in your chamber,”","We have again a possible double entendre as ""costure"" can refer to sewing or the cultivation of land (a common metaphor for reproduction). I invite the English reader to hear sew/sow in this verse.","""Go in your chamber and sew,""",
2529,Cho violt de nature li us.,for nature demands this!,That’s what Nature’s usage wants of you!,,"This is Nature’s path, custom for him.","Here again we can see desired paths for Silence (see also verses 2474, 2543, and 2614 in this passage). I have pulled this verse out of Nature's speech and given it to the narrator because it feels more natural as an interjected observation coming from the narrator.",Nature desired for him thus:,
2530,Tu nen es pas Scilentius!”,You are not Silentius!”,You are not Silentius!”,,“You are not Silentius!”,,"""You are not Silentius!""",

2583,Fu ainc mais feme si tanee,Was ever a woman so tormented,Was any female ever so tormented,,Was any woman ever so tanned,"""Tanee"" can mean both ""tanned"" and ""tormented"". I kept tanned because the text spends a lot of time describing the tanning of Silence's skin. Plus to ""tan someone's hide"" is to punish them similar to the way Silence is being physically corrected by his/her guardians, and ""tanning"" may be another reference to the craftwork performed on Silence's body by the hands of Nurture.",Was any woman ever so tanned,

Silence has been fooled and engineered by disingenuous actors. For ""barat"" (meaning ""commerce,"" ""agitation/confusion,"" ""tromperie,"" or ""voleur""), we also have the verb ""barater"" meaning ""battre le crème dans une baratte,"" and ""churning"" is a term that can be used to refer to a type of financial securities fraud.

2595,Jo l’ai tolte desnaturee.,I have completely denatured her.,I have completely dis-natured her.,,I have totally denatured her.,"It's interesting that Nurture refers to Silence in the feminine form considering Nurture is trying to reform Silence into a young man.

Compare with verses 2565 and 2649. Is this a play on the pronoun ""je"" which along with other variants can be spelled ""ju"" or ""jo"" as we see elsewhere in this passage?

Then, the adjective ""rois"" can mean ""dur""/""ferme,"" ""impétueux""/""violent,"" ""rudement,"" and I feel like there must be a pun here on ""king"" as well.
